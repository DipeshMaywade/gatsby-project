Whether you are an avenger fan or a GOT admirer, watching it all in time is very important at this point of time. This is a period where people post spoilers in a matter of minutes on Instagram or Twitter. If you have missed one episode or the movie due to your tight work schedule, people are all set to ruin the anticipation you have for your favorite franchise.</p>\n<p>So, to reduce the area of your minefield, we are here to guide your mood killers. The people who are giving the spoilers, let’s make it fair. You can give out the spoilers but at least wait for a while before giving out spoilers with context.</p>\n<p>The question here is what is the acceptable time-period when you can actually discuss the show or movie without being an arse?</p>\n<p>Matt Zoller Seitz has an answer to this question and it is not that simple. The editor in chief of RogerEbert.com said that when it comes to content, people have different time frames of discussing their favorite TV series or movie. According to him, you should at least wait for 48 hours to give away any thoughts you have on the franchise.</p>\n<p>This can be confusing as the telecast time of a show in the U.K and the U.S is one day apart. The internet doesn’t care about your time zone, people will start posting once it is over for them.</p>\n<p>For movies, Matt says that it is okay to discuss after a week of release. Also, for the shows on Netflix and other online platforms, it is acceptable if you discuss the episode after about four days of streaming.</p>\n<p>He said that rest is in the hands of the spoilee, when to give away all the anticipated fun online. If your spoilee is considerate enough towards your interest then you may have a smooth road ahead. And if you can’t control that factor, you have to accept that the possibility of a spoiler coming your way is 100% unless you lock yourself inside the room without internet. Because hey, the night is dark and it is full of spoilers.</p>\n<p>That is the only way to stay away from killing your anticipation. Or you could just take some time out and get to see all the fun and suspense for yourself.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/the-question-of-the-hour-when-to-give-away-spoilers/\">The Question Of The Hour: When To Give Away Spoilers?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>We all know the struggle of avoiding places, people, social media platforms and all the other places where you can come across spoilers.

NASA has an advantage here as Scott has an identical twin which makes it easier for them to discover what all happens to a person’s body once they have left the earth for a while.</p>\n<p>They have been part of various medical tests that can direct the team of researchers towards some helpful results regarding the study.</p>\n<p>The examination is still in progress even though Scott came back three years ago. Some of the conclusions that the scientists made after an in-depth analysis are shocking and puzzling at the same time.</p>\n<p>The immune system of Scott was affected in certain ways making it very responsive and hyper-activated, but that wasn’t the case for Mark.</p>\n<p>The next inference from this research was the increase in the activity of DNA repair by the genes in Scott’s body. The comparison was made with Mark’s DNA.</p>\n<p>Finally, the components of blood were put under the microscope in both cases. The mitochondria count in the case of Scott was definitely higher than Mark’s.</p>\n<p>Christopher Mason, a Geneticist described these changes by saying, “It&#8217;s as if the body is reacting to this alien environment sort of like you would a mysterious organism being inside you.”</p>\n<p>As NASA looks forward to stepping on Mars and discovering all that the planet has in store for humans, this information is crucial as the astronauts need to be prepared before they go ahead for a “Mars tour”.</p>\n<p>The data that has come to light is being scrutinized and the people involved in the research are still in the process of finding out if the results point towards positive news or a negative one. That’s still under contemplation.</p>\n<p>Craig Kundrot, director of NASA&#8217;s Space Life and Physical Sciences Research and Applications Division explained the situation. According to him, the changes observed in Scott can be just the body’s way of reacting to a sudden shift in the elements of the environment. However, he added that it can be a matter of concern too and that’s what is being prioritized right now.</p>\n<p>He said, “It&#8217;s mostly green flags, and maybe a handful of things that are roughly like yellow flags, things just to keep an eye on.”</p>\n<p>When a person spends 340 days outside the earth, the body is sure to go through certain adjustments so, Mark and Scott had different internal functioning of the body despite having similar genes.</p>\n<p>Spaceflight has a huge impact on a person’s health and hence, it is important for NASA to consider all the aspects before taking the next step of sending the astronauts to Mars. There will be further studies and results revolving around this in the future too.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/what-space-travel-does-to-a-humans-body-researchers-at-nasa-find-out-through-a-study-on-identical-twins/\">What Space Travel Does To A Human’s Body?

It’s everything in between and around that makes us fall in love with the characters and their stories.</p>\n<p>The psychologist said that he has been working for about 20 years now and the trick that works for patients with anxiety is repetitive and relational nature of programs, the ones like F.R.I.E.N.D.S or Big Bang Theory. He believes that anxiety is the human mind’s alarm system that tells a person that something is wrong and is mainly just a product of piled up feelings.</p>\n<p>The buildup of these feelings is similar to that of a pressure cooker and every pressure needs to find a way out of your system.</p>\n<p>He says, “If they can&#8217;t find a way of being expressed, the alarm system triggers, and it is usually not very pleasant for the person suffering from the anxiety. Few people who suffer from anxiety will have much good to say about it, and will want to escape it.”</p>\n<p>The relatability you have with characters, their problems make things easier for you, and you get a sense of comfort and escapism from the episodes.</p>\n<p>Mark says that watching F.R.I.E.N.D.S repairs your worries and you get soothed, mostly in the case of relationships. The show represents complex problems that people have and resolving them is not that big deal.</p>\n<p>If you are one of those who find the show very simple and nothing experimental, then Mark wants you to know that this relatability and predictability of the show is effective and soothes your anxiety.</p>\n<p>So, if you are currently amidst anxiety and pressure, start watching the show for the 39th time.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/want-to-reduce-anxiety-psychologist-says-get-hooked-to-tv-series-f-r-i-e-n-d-s-for-the-solution/\">Want To Reduce Anxiety?

In 2008, he left Facebook to be a volunteer for Barack Obama’s presidential campaign. He then took his career’s tangent in the field of public service and media. Currently, he is living upstate New York with Sean Eldridge, his husband. His net worth is whopping $430 MILLION DOLLARS.</p>\n<h3>2.

He went ahead and co-founded the philanthropic organization Good Ventures. Forbes declared him as the youngest self-made billionaire in history in 2011. It was also because of the 2.34% share in Facebook. His net worth stands at $11.6 million.</p>\n<h3>4.

He warmed up his mind with a plan to hack into its servers without thinking about its virulent repercussions. With the help of another teen, who was 16 years old at that time, he hit hard on the giant’s mainframe and downloaded the internal documents of the company. He achieved his objective by shaping up false credentials to sneak into the mainstream servers of the giant.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, Apple did not suffer a financial scar from this intrepid spree. This hacking story was eventually reported to FBI which later colluded with Australian Federal Police to hit a trick on the teens. As claimed by Gizmodo Australia, police seized 90 GB files from their “hacky hack hack” folder. After inspecting each and every page of it, the police took them in their custody.</p>\n<p>Finally, they were punished but managed to escape the jail term. The boy has been awarded a nine-month-old good behavior bond for the entire ruckus created by him. His accomplice was too found guilty and awarded an eight-month-old good behavior bond in 2018.

Taking cognizance of its stardom, Alanis made up his mind and strived to set a record for himself too. So he embarked himself on the trail of cementing the record of watching the film for around 200 times.</p>\n<p>To his delight, he recently achieved the big haul of watching the movie for the 116th time. He has come a long way and is a few steps apart from bagging his paramount goal. Riverview Cinema is his favorite spot to fuel his desire. He usually visits it twice on weekdays. Weekends witness his more often visits to the theatre. He enjoys his outing to the fullest by posing with the theatre staff for selfies. He then posts them with some quotes from the movie. Not just that, he also tags the stars and big personalities associated with this installment of Avengers.

If you think it is related to the adversities that our planet is facing, then you are so wrong! The views are on the same old topic that needs to get over already. Yes, it’s about the flatness and roundness of the earth.</p>\n<p>Safvan is adamant about his beliefs for the earth being flat and lays down all the reasons for it being so. He started to believe in this theory when he was 18. The properties of water led him to believe in this as the water can never “curl into a ball” this way. He explained that gravity cannot be the factor here.</p>\n<p>He questions the curvature of this “sphere” per mile according to the size of the planet given by the scientists. He states that the calculated curvature puts a question mark on existing scenarios on our planet like viewing the Chicago skyline from the opposite side of Lake Michigan. This is not something new in this discussion!</p>\n<p>Safvan is a member of the online community that dismisses any fact that states that the earth is round. This community is large and the number of members is on the rise.<br />\nAll these theorists who are convinced by the flat earth concept gain their understanding from watching videos on YouTube.</p>\n<p>Safvan is quick in giving explanations to hold his theory.</p>\n<p>So, you thought Antarctica is at the bottom of the globe? Safvan says it is all around our earth. This is his claim!</p>\n<p>He questions, “Why do you think only researchers are allowed to go there?”</p>\n<p>When he was presented with a counter question on this about the believers of flat-earth taking a boat and confirming this themselves, he seemed baffled!</p>\n<p>Safvan is not ready to give up and continues to blame various societies for filling the minds of people with the facts of the earth being a sphere.</p>\n<p>Illuminati is on that target list! What is this Illuminati he is referring to? It is a fictitious secret society that includes politicians and global financiers.</p>\n<p>The next target is NASA which he describes as a multi-billion fraud. We know that sounds bizarre! But not to him and his community. He said, “They can send Neil Armstrong in space in 1969. Why don&#8217;t they send people to the moon in 2019? Why don’t they send astronauts towards the moon right now?”</p>\n<p>He is confident that all the images that are revealed by NASA are computer-generated imagery.</p>\n<p>Safvan and other flat-earth believers connect God and religion to their theory as well. They say that we are all the creations of God and question others who accept any other thing related to this.</p>\n<p>He is completely opposed to the process of teaching geography to kids with a globe. It creates a “wrong” concept in their mind. That’s what he thinks!</p>\n<p>Despite being aware of all the jokes going around regarding this theory of flat earth, Safvan is firm on his decision to be a part of this community and truly believes in this. He is positive about this and says, “There’s a lot of people getting into flat earth in London.”</p>\n<p>We don’t know what the future holds for him and others on this path, but we only hope for the truth to remain and settle this for once and all!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/there-is-an-increase-in-the-believers-of-flat-earth-this-science-graduate-is-another-member-of-the-club/\">There Is An Increase In The Believers Of Flat Earth, This Science Graduate Is Another Member Of The Club</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>India-born Safvan is a science graduate living in east London who is presenting some queer opinions about the earth.

I heard you launched a Stranger Things pop-up bar at your Logan Square location.”<br />\nWe are already loving the mention of walkie-talkie here!</p>\n<p>They stated their point by writing, “You&#8217;re obviously creative types, so I&#8217;m sure you can appreciate that it&#8217;s important to us to have a say in how our fans encounter the worlds we build.”</p>\n<p>The owners might have put a lot of thought behind this bar, but forgot to take permission from the ones who own the show. This might be because the fans get too excited and take impulsive decisions.</p>\n<p>The letter explained to them the issue with their pop-up bar and what they need to do further to avoid any trouble.</p>\n<p>It read, “We’re not going to go full Dr. Brenner on you, but we ask that you please (1) not extend the pop-up beyond its 6 week run ending in September, and (2) reach out to us for permission if you plan to do something like this again.”</p>\n<p>The lawyer finally ended the letter by asking to inform them when they will follow these requests. The final words were, “Please don’t make us call your mom.”</p>\n<p>This is a really witty way to get your work done without hurting the feeling of the person on the other side. Netflix has a lot to offer than just the amazing shows! This letter is proof.</p>\n<p>Watch the show as many times you want.

The portrayal was a real-life depiction of the ‘atonement’ of Jane Shore who was one of the many mistresses of King Edward IV in the 1400s.

There were sharply stoned laid down her path that tore her bare feet. Unlike Cersei, her troubles didn’t end with just the walk and she wasn’t pulled to safety instead she was put into the Ludgate Prison until Thomas Lynom, king’s solicitor general proposed to her.

Like, what? We had imagined that these past few years’ achievements in the domain of professional gaming would be something new and exciting, but to earn this much amount people would have to change their profession.</p>\n<p>You could literally earn anything from $25,000 to $50,000 by attracting about 16,000 or more viewers, when you are requested by publishers to play and stream their newly released video game.</p>\n<p>In an interview, CEO of the Online Performers Group revealed, “We’ve seen offers well over $50k an hour, as well as many six-and seven-figure deals for longer term engagements. I can’t share specific companies, as the payment terms are usually confidential. We had one offer from a publisher that was $60,000 per hour for two hours. The broadcaster declined it- and the publisher came back with a ‘blank check’ offer, which was still declined. Bigger audiences (typically anything over 5,000 viewers) tend to be younger and have lower engagement, so you can’t just say something like ‘1 viewer for 1 hour =$1.’ Not all streamers generate the same results.”</p>\n<p>One of the most popular streamer, Ninja played Apex on sponsored streams for 20 hours over a period of few days, you can do the math. Blevins earned nearly $10 million last year and revealed that he earns about $500,000 on a ‘good month’. You may think that the amounts are a bit too much, but you see, Apex Legends brought over 50 million players in its first month of video game release. No wonder they pay this much to the streamers.</p>\n<p>A warning that comes with it is that, as these companies pay such huge amount to the Streamers, their opinions on certain games can be a bit biased. With this increase in the trend, it is the most effective way to promote compared to the traditional publicizing, which had required millions of dollars spending on less effective forms.

To everyone’s surprise, 74% of the online games have suffered from harassment of various kinds. Out of these, one-third of LGBTQ games have faced harassment on the ground of sexual orientation. One-third of black/Africa-American souls have experienced harassment on the field of ethnicity. One-fourth of Latinx and Asian-American have too shared the same fate.</p>\n<p>Out of these sufferers, women form the major chunk. They have often got harassed on the gender-basis. Thus 40% of women have claimed the title of being the most vulnerable group. Also, 23% of the people claimed to find a conversation of supremacy of whites over blacks. According to the report, “While this result does not necessarily imply that players were being recruited to join a white supremacist organization in any online game, the prevalence of expressions of white supremacy in online games suggests that this hateful ideology may be normalized in some game subcultures”.</p>\n<p>According to the report, publishers are mainly to be blamed for the situation. Toxicity-thriving in the online content does not get much attention from them. As a result, the situation had got worse for the world. Dannie Kelley-Associate Director of ADL shared that large-scale commercial game had those aspects of their platform that were totally unmoderated spaces. For instance: 4chan and 8chan.</p>\n<p>Out of the major games, CS: GO, PUBG, League of Legends and Dota 2 top the chart on the parameter of toxicity.

They can assiduously choose their game in order to grab the right part.</p>\n<p>For the survey, ADL surveyed around 100 online gamers. The survey questioned them about the approach of publishers dealing with harassment. Also, it asked them to share the incident of bad trolling, hate speech, threats and sexism that took place on the platform during the play or interaction. Finally, they compiled the information and promulgated the facts.</p>\n<p>To take on the problem, Kelly came up with the suggestion to establish rating boards like ESRB. This could help the gamers know the ethical standard of the games and kick out those who do not fit in the space of a healthy environment.</p>\n<p>The suggestion is indeed effective enough to get its place in the real world.

The study provided a perfect explanation of that phenomenon.</p>\n<p>The younger star-J160540.18-144323.1 traces its genesis back to the explosion of older one. 35000 light-years away from Earth, the star exploded into a supernova. According to Thomas Nordlander- the lead author astronomer of the study, the supernova energy of the ancestral star was very low. The heavier elements had fallen back into very dense remnant created by the explosion. Also, only a tiny fraction of the elements heavier than carbon escaped into space and helped to form the very old star that they had found. So that marked the beginning of a new phase.</p>\n<p>The exploded star belonged to Population III generation of stars as it was 10 times as large as the sun. Population I stars were very large-100 times bigger than Sun. The astronomer called it a time machine that took them back to the Universe’s earliest stars. Also, Nordlander shared that the pattern of elements that they found in the star in our galaxy revealed traces of its ancestor.</p>\n<p>According to them, carbon elements escaped from the older star and thrived in the younger star-SMSSJ160540.18-144323.1. This star is situated in the Milky Way galaxy which is our very own galaxy. Co-author Martin Asplund said that they could study the first stars through their children. The astronomers are all set to explore the dark side.</p>\n<p>In the domain of study of stars, NASA had brought out that the Universe was formed roughly 13.7 billion years ago. The first stars came up about 200 years came up about 200 million years later. The Agency has also shed some light on its process. According to it, Gravity had pulled in more matter from areas of lower density and clumps had grown. After that clumping, there was enough matter that raised the temperature to ignite the process of fusion. Thus, stars started to glow.</p>\n<p>The ‘time machine’ star has opened the gates for new successful discoveries by our genius astronomers. It can take them through the lanes of the evolution of our mighty Universe. Astronomers are thrilled and set to lay down the roadmap to take a lead in that domain.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/evidence-suggests-time-machine-star-found-35000-light-years-from-earth/\">Evidence Suggests ‘Time Machine’ Star Found 35,000 Light-Years From Earth</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Going through the lanes of Space history one day, the astronomers came across an amazing finding.

To their surprise, they managed to achieve that feat. Then they looked for the mechanism through which they could control the devices as hackers. The hacked devices included a laptop, a smart phone, a Bluetooth speaker, a smart speaker, a pair of over-ear headphones, a vehicle-mounted public address system, a vibration speaker and a parametric speaker. After the installation of malware in the devices, they went ahead to keep each of the hacked devices in soundproof containers. For that experiment, they picked-up containers having sound level and temperature measures fitted in them.</p>\n<p>The results of the study were astonishing. They found that smart speaker, the headphones and the parametric speaker, out of the hacked devices, were controlled to give high frequency. On the other hand, the Bluetooth speakers, the noise-cancelling headphones and the smart speakers emitted abnormally low frequencies when they were controlled by experts.</p>\n<p>Not just that, they also found that the smart speakers melted in five minutes when attacks (malware attacks) were inflicted on the targeted devices. As a result, they got permanently damaged. Also, in the case of the internet-connected smart speaker, the attacks proved that the acoustic devices could be attacked without any physical access to the devices.</p>\n<p>In the end, the experts claimed that the hackers could track the movements of the victims by making the hacked devices emit frequencies. The firm ensured that they would not release the malware and had not afflicted human beings for its experiments. On this part, Wixey said that there were a lot of ethical considerations and they wanted to minimize the risk.

This made them rank outsiders and they had no chance of fighting in the tournament let alone win it.</p>\n<p>The fact they wore their dharma robes while collecting their prize money became a reason many people were upset.

It does not send a good and right message to the rest of the world. But the head monk believed that every individual has the right to experience whatever he/she wants to experience especially when it is written in their destiny.</p>\n<p>He said, “the novices are just children, like other people their age that need to grow, develop their skills and explore their interests…. we wanted to give the students an opportunity.

They can spot jealous souls, lovers, adversaries locking their horns and much more. Stephan from SNL shared that the mystic trip had everything-jealous and jilted lovers, a rival mafioso, a pair of undercover feds and plenty more. Grabbing each of these details, the passengers have to untangle the mystery and bring the culprit into light during the trip.</p>\n<p>And of course, the train offers some great shots of classic wines while it makes its way through California’s wine country. Not just the wine, the traditional and lavish meals of the country are also there to tickle the hungry nerve of the passengers. The menu includes Sonoma salad, soup du join, beef tenderloin, Yellow fish tuna, etc.</p>\n<p>The tourists can also look forward to some sightseeing, romantic events, etc. Dress code is also on the list to give the tourist a real-time experience. Though the clause is not compulsory for all the passengers but they would love to embrace the charm of a tassel skirt, feather baa, sequined headband, elbow-length gloves, etc.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bzq8YElFoFO/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Not just the space agencies but many big enterprises are too looking up to it to harness its immeasurable potential. Samsung also joined that spree to land its space selfie recently. But the news of a space equipment landing in the garden of Welke’s property raised many brows about its first space selfie initiative.</p>\n<p>It was a beautiful morning for the couple. The clock was ticking 8:45 a.m. At that time, they were gearing up to give their horses some pearls of air. So they were heading towards the stable to get the beautiful creatures out to bask in the warmth of morning sun rays. But then came a loud thud from their garden. It made their blood run cold and became deer-in-headlights.</p>\n<p>They rushed in their front garden. The souls got astonished to find space equipment crashed in there. They were still shuddering as the equipment was buzzing with sounds. The scared souls moved ahead to figure its identity out. Then they discovered the title- “SPACE SELFIE”.</p>\n<p>After getting done with their investigation part, they concluded that it was a piece of space equipment that landed in their garden with a parachute. Then they got into the roots of its crash. They got to know that it was a low-altitude balloon which was a part of the device.</p>\n<p>It got tangled in the power lines on Barry Rd. So the equipment ended up landing in the garden of their Michigan property. After the news of the crash surfaced in the media world, the speculation started building up that connected the equipment with space selfie initiative of Samsung.</p>\n<p>Samsung made headlines by declaring that it had unveiled the world’s first selfie sent to space. According to the giant, Cara Delevingne- the actor, model and philanthropist captured it. Adding to that, it shared that the selfie was the first of many it would lift into the stratosphere that month as part of SpaceSelfie- a mission to give everyone the chance to get their face in space.</p>\n<p>Radio 1 DJ Clara Amfo anchored the event by launching Cara who shared her first SpaceSelfie on Samsung S10+. In her selfie, one could see the actress holding a peace sign donning an astronaut helmet. Not just that but she also took a group selfie with Fedez (Italian rapper and judge on Italian X-Factor).</p>\n<p>Taking on that part, she said, “I&#8217;m honored to be Samsung&#8217;s SpaceSelfie pioneer! To celebrate, I wanted to take the first group selfie to go to space. I can&#8217;t wait for my fans to join us in space and get their hands on a SpaceSelfie of their own”.</p>\n<p>The giant had also revealed, “Images will then be selected at random, displayed on Galaxy S10 5G&#8217;s 6.7-inch screen and captured using a unique view of planet earth as the backdrop. This photo will be sent back down to earth for its owner to share on social media”.</p>\n<p>According to some sources, the Samsung staff (apparently) got there to collect the remnants of the crashed equipment.</p>\n<p>Hopefully the couple would be able to put aside the fears of having more space equipment falling over them!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/family-shocked-when-equipment-from-space-rained-into-their-garden/\">Family Shocked When Equipment From Space Rained Into Their Garden</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Space is shining in the list of the most alluring elements for humans.

Normally a single dose of radiation of 5,000 mSv can cause half of the people exposed to it die within a month.</p>\n<p>Whereas the threshold for relocating the people from the Chernobyl site was just 350 mSv.

But despite everything, the place is still a hit for the tourists is claimed that way by the local guides there.

There is boosting research done in order to buck up one and engage him in walking fast. Academics from Duke University in North Carolina conducted a study and have published their findings in the Journal of the American Medical Association. They researched and concluded that fast walkers have healthier minds compared to the slow pace walkers.</p>\n<p>The study said that slow walkers have shown many symptoms of accelerating aging and signs showed that their lungs, teeth and immune system tend to be in worse shape. More than nine hundred men and women were chosen from New Zealand to conduct this study and researchers were able to link a slower gait to poor health. To make the study more effective, they tracked them from when they were just toddlers and asked them to engage in regular tests until the one final test at 45-years-old.</p>\n<p>Dr. Line Rasmussen led the research and told that &#8220;The thing that&#8217;s really striking is that this is in 45-year-old people, not the geriatric patients who are usually assessed with such measures.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But it was not only just physical health that was flagged with slower walkers. Researches also concluded and came up with their data stating that toddlers with lower IQ scores or linguistic ability or capacity to tolerate frustration or motor skills and emotional control were also linked with a slow gait.</p>\n<p>However, there are various alternatives been put up to help. One of the Chinese city realized that there are people who tend to stroll when they&#8217;re on their phone and has developed a special lane for those who reckon it&#8217;s more important to read Facebook or Twitter while they&#8217;re walking than actually looking at what&#8217;s around them.</p>\n<p>A similar lane has been established that is one thousand feet long and has been painted in the Shaanxi Province around a shopping center.

It is a disease that causes a deformity in the skull and neck. But sometimes the cases are worse when it reaches the spinal cord. The spinal cord damage is called syringomyelia, it is straightforward to identify but the pain associated with it is not easy to detect.</p>\n<p>But a solution to that problem has also been found, which is artificial intelligence. Researchers from the University of Surrey’s Center for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP) and School of Veterinary Medicine (SVM), in their detailed paper published in the Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine, explained their method in detail.</p>\n<p>Adrian Hilton, Surrey professor and director of CVSSP, explained in his statement how the project works. The artificial intelligence will provide a new diagnostic tool for animal health. Using the technique of mapping and MRI the pain areas would be identified and further course of the treatment would be decided.</p>\n<p>The team discovered various patterns in the MRI through mapping technique which will further help the vets to identify dogs suffering from CM-associated pain. The technique involves the neural tissue, sphenoid bone, canines’ third ventricle, and presphenoid bone.</p>\n<p>Lead study author Michaela Spiteri, a research student at CVSSP, said in her statement that Cavalier King Charles Spaniel’s that are suffering from the terrible disease can be cured with time with the help of machine learning. It will not only help the four-legged members of our family to live in peace but would also help them to not suffer the disease at all with the help of regular check-ups.</p>\n<p>In the research, it was also found that dogs suffering from this disease have a skull and neck which is different in shape and size from the rest of the dogs. It is the first identification one can identify. They also have a reduced nasal tissue. “This study suggests that the whole skull, rather than just the hindbrain, should be analyzed in diagnostic tests,” according to co-author Penny Knowler of the research paper.</p>\n<p>“It also impacts … how we should interpret MRI from affected dogs” she continued, “and the choices we make when we breed predisposed dogs and develop breeding recommendations.”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/artificial-intelligence-is-the-solution-to-chronic-pains-in-dogs/\">Artificial Intelligence Is The Solution To Chronic Pains In Dogs</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>With the help of a new artificial intelligence technique, veterinaries will be able to detect chronic diseases causing unbearable pain to the animals.

Thus, she had expected the things to see the light of dusk in an elegant way for Cersei. But to her dismay, it did not go the way of her high powered expectations.</p>\n<p>The final season of the series presented an insipid culmination of her part. Cersei Lannister embraced the sword of death with her brother Jaime Lannister under the Red keep in the show. It was not just shocking to her but for the fans also. They had better plots of death of the character in the show in their mind. Thus, their dismay nudged them to file a petition to recreate the final season of Games of Thrones with a better shot.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_589\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-589\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-589\" src=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/cersie.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/cersie.jpg 600w, https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/cersie-150x150.jpg 150w, https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/cersie-300x300.jpg 300w, https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/cersie-420x420.jpg 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-589\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Instagram</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Revealing her dismay in one of her interviews after the end of the show, she shared, “I will say I wanted a better death. Obviously you dream of your death. You could go in any way on that show. So I was kind of gutted. But, I just think they couldn’t have pleased everyone. No matter what they did, I think there was going to be some big comedown from the climb”.</p>\n<p>But the time for complaints had gone for the fans. Lena too decided to get on with the things in her life. According to her, she had enough of the vibrant offers in the bag of her career. Thus, there was ample scope for her to make a fantastic come back. Taking on that part, she said, “I invested as a viewer and I have my favorite characters. And I’ve got a few of my own gripes. But, I haven’t sat down drunkly with David [Benioff] and Dan [Weiss] yet.”</p>\n<p>The matter of death of Cersei would remain deep in the heart of the fans of the series and Lena. But the things had to slip by to put the triggers down.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, Lena would get her better part next time. May the character of Cersei rest in peace within her.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/lena-headey-wished-for-a-better-death-in-got/\">Lena Headey Wished For A ‘Better Death’ In GOT</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>‘Games of Thrones’ saw the end of its day a few months back.

Most of the time, right? Everyone tends to save some money and buy second hand games. Although buying second hand games might be a good idea but there are various online frauds selling fake games. Amazon and Nintendo have come up with a new idea of tackling such things.","title":"Nintendo Games Now Need Approval To Be Sold On Amazon","user_id":61},{"id":"313","agency_id":1,"content":"<p>While there are studies been conducted and already done on how video games affect the youth and how it is a major concern of addiction to the youth. The Chinese government is introducing new curfews and restrictions regarding online gaming. Not only the government will limit the time spent on playing online video games but it will also restrict the amount of money one can spend on it.</p>\n<p>Children and adults are so addicted to video games that they put everything secondary to it even having food and going to the washroom. The majority of their time is spent playing games. Playing video games is important and one should play it but everything should be done in a limit. Thus, the parents are happy with these curfews and restrictions.</p>\n<p>This is the biggest online curfew and the change introduced in the lives of people of a nation. Until now there were no curfews but bans on the sites which the government thought are not good for the people of the country. Some of the restrictions are such as children under the age of 18 years cannot play video games between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m.</p>\n<p>During weekdays they can only play for 90 minutes and on weekends and holidays, they can play for 180 minutes. So now they not only have to plan their time to study but effectively manage their time to play video games. Also, this will ensure that children will take breaks from their online gaming marathons and have food and water to survive. Their mothers do not have to hand feed them.</p>\n<p>You might think that this can be controlled from the parental control software and the government need not worry about the curfews and controls then. But the Chinese government has taken it to another level. Now the players not only have to register them online in the parental control software but also in the police database to play online video games.</p>\n<p>Players have to register their original names in the police database, and the registrations have been made blanket-wide. But everybody wants the freedom to make their own decisions where they live and stay healthy irrespective of the decisions made there is a part of the notice that protects their right to make their own decisions. Apart from “Notice on Preventing Minors from Indulging in Online Games” it protects that right.</p>\n<p>The new rules also limit the money that can be spent on playing video games. While the players between the age of 8 years and 16 years can spend about $29 per month, the players under the age of 18 years but more than 16 years can spend $57 per month. Many games trap the kids and lead them into wasting thousand of their money and precious time playing games which have a bad effect on health and life.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/chinese-government-restricted-time-and-money-spent-on-playing-video-games/\">Chinese Government Restricted Time And Money Spent On Playing Video Games</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>While there are studies been conducted and already done on how video games affect the youth and how it is a major concern of addiction to the youth.

But that is not the end of the story of their hard work. They have to face the wrath of space conditions. Their bodies go through many changes that can wreak havoc on their lives. A team of researchers has presented another facet of this story by connecting their condition with that of cancer patients.</p>\n<p>The researchers have studied and followed the body mechanisms of astronauts and cancer patients parallelly. After putting in efforts for long periods, they achieved a big feat. They ended up noting down some stunning similarities between the changes in the bodies of astronauts and cancer patients. According to the study, both groups go through muscle mass loss, bone “demineralization”, etc. Not just that, they have also linked the problem of ‘space fog’ in astronauts with the ‘chemo brain’ problem in cancer patients.</p>\n<p>Taking on that part, Jessica Scott (senior study author and an exercise physiology researcher at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center’s Exercise Oncology Service) shared, “Both have a decrease in muscle mass, and they have bone demineralization, and changes in heart function”. Adding to that, she said, “Astronauts may get something called ‘space fog,’ where they have trouble focusing or get a little forgetful. That’s very similar to what some cancer patients experience, which is called ‘chemo brain’”.</p>\n<p>Also, according to her, it was surprising when they had looked at similarities.</p>\n<p>So the study stresses the role of physical activities like walking, etc. in lowering down the side effects of the treatment of cancer. It is a stunning fact that most of the cancer experts go ahead to give importance to the treatment of cancer only. They overlook the need to devise the ways to deal with its side effects. According to a study, 90% of the early-stage cancer survivors do not go through the framework to put down the side effects of their cancer treatments.</p>\n<p>Grabbing that fact, Scott said, “That’s why it’s very timely that we start thinking about how to utilize NASA’s tactics to manage some of these long-term side effects of cancer treatments. Many patients aren’t dying from their cancer, but they’re now at risk of dying from these side effects. Using NASA’s exercise plan could help with this”.</p>\n<p>So her team is working on the plans to provide in-home treadmills and software to let patients come in contact with them to work on their fitness while going through their treatments.</p>\n<p>Well, a lot more is still to come from their side. But it seems like NASA can play a significant role in curbing the physical illness of cancer patients.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/study-reveals-astronaut-training-routine-may-help-cancer-patients/\">Study Reveals Astronaut Training Routine May Help Cancer Patients</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Astronauts endure hard to get in shape and form before donning their spacesuits.

Crazy enough that some great men with “great minds” are willing to give thousands of dollars to “free” mobile games while resisting a $60 retail release. Other thing to be considered is the number of rubes which we contributed to the ongoing deceit by Star Citizen, a game that encourages you to hundreds of dollars on fake spaceships on a game which doesn’t even have a virtual existence. And the time when you are willing to five up a kind of dough for a completely digital product, that is when you need to be extra cautious before its vanishes out of your league.</p>\n<p>As per the South China Morning Post (reported by Kotaku), such a situation which will not let you sleep a wink, was on the brink of becoming a bad experience of a lifetime to an unfortunate Chinese gamer. This player spent $1.4 million on his character in Justice Online, an MMORPG, was on the verge of losing his favourite self-created character due to the heedlessness and malicious attitude of his very friend!</p>\n<p>Like many other online social games, Justice Online has a mini market complex, virtually, where players can lend and sell items. Do you remember something similar as this, the original Diablo 3? The game comes from NetEase, who now have a significant stake in Bungie, which is worth the money, considering how Destiny works.</p>\n<p>But as far as Justice Online is concerned, the original player lent his inordinate gaming character to a friend. Seemingly, the friend then tried to sell the character back in the gaming market for about $55,000, but by mistake, marked the price as $552 in lieu. The ultimate result of this casual bargain was another player, who crackled up the whole scenario before any other sales could be done.</p>\n<p>Thanks to his lucky starts, it all turned out to be normal once again. The sale was reversed. The character returned to its original owner, and the wary player, who knowing nothing about the seller’s intention, bought the character has now received around $12,000 for damages. Now this hullabaloo will make you all think over again that why China wants to enforce stricter gaming regulations, even if we don’t favor it.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/a-man-was-about-to-lose-1-4-million-gaming-character/\">A Man Was About To Lose $1.4 Million Gaming Character</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Most of us are ever ready to spend a bountiful amount of money on video games.

The baker has shared the easy recipe of cookie on Instagram. To make the Baby Yoda cookies we require an angel shaped cookie cutter. Beheading the angel will result in outline of Baby Yoda. Then black food colouring gel is mixed with tiny specks of white frosting that are placed in the corner with a toothpick, this will add cuteness and with this delicious meme cookie that you can scarf down is ready.</p>\n<p>The Baby Yoda cookies have gained much popularity since the discovery. The Baker commented: “I’m grateful my cookies are breaking the internet and most everyone’s reviews are positive.”, but it’s usually a lot of social attention that stirs up some anxiety and stress. She exclaimed that she might be eating the last few frozen cookies that she had stored in the freezer before the Christmas Day.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/decapitating-angel-cookies-to-make-baby-yoda-cookies/\">Decapitating Angel Cookies to Make Baby Yoda Cookies</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>The little alien character colloquially referred to as “Baby Yoda “by fans and media is a fictional character from the Mandalorian, A Disney+ original television series which is in relation to the famous movie series Star Wars.

Those who know Star Wars in and out are acquainted with the fact that the protosaber is the antediluvian predecessor of the lightsaber, and functions using the battery power.</p>\n<p>As per the Wookiepedia, the hilt of the weapon is connected to an external power source via a cable because of the limitations in the current power pack technology. The power supply needed for this weapon to function could not be placed on or inside the original arm, thus, the ancient Jedis were pushed to fight along with the battery containers hanging over their shoulders or around their waist, oh yes you imagined that right, the most superior space beings would have to fight with such burdens.</p>\n<p>The Hacksmith which is a YouTube channel works on the basis of creating real-life prototypes from fictional movies- this mainly includes video games, comics, etc. The team has now decided to work on the Star Wars series and the first thing that has been launched is the protosaber or something extremely close to it.</p>\n<p>And although it doesn’t really function in the same way it is surely commendable in its own standing. Instead of the regular plasma beam used in the standard solid form, the Hacksmith used a twenty-kilowatt power coursing that runs through a think rod of tungsten creating enough energy to run and energize nearly half of the North American houses. This results in a highly heated and super dangerous blade capable of causing some serious threat and damage. Luckily, the creators do not under or overestimate the force’s power but is it a real lightsaber? Well, not really but surely it is badass.</p>\n<p>So would you want to build or buy yourself one?</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/the-famous-protosaber-from-star-wars-is-now-a-reality/\">The Famous ‘Protosaber’ From Star Wars Is Now A Reality</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>By far away we mean on a totally different planet in a totally different galaxy, a galaxy that as of now is beyond human understanding and creation abilities, but obviously it does not mean that we have to give up or that we can never be super close to our dreams.

You have to trust us on this one, the trick to making these beverages really resemble baby Yoda is to consume them, the more you drink from them the more Yoda-like they become.</p>\n<p>If you’re a gin lover and if that is your thing, a bar in Minnesota has one perfect baby Yoda gin tonic to offer, they use lime slices for ears, cherries for eyes. The reason why these drinks are gaining so much momentum and the limelight is that everything is better with a little alcohol, so these beverages are highly encouraged and in demand.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B6UA8q8D7rx/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

It was considered as waste until a researcher from Queen’s University Belfast developed a low-cost technique for converting the breweries’ leftover barley into a source of renewable energy. The researcher has just used 1 kg of the leftover barley that can be used in 100 soccer fields.</p>\n<p>Ahmed Osman is the researcher from Queen’s University Belfast who has developed this technique of converting leftover barley into a source of renewable energy. 1kg of barley is enough to create activated carbon which can be properly used for 100 soccer fields. A full-size soccer pitch is about 120-by-75 yards, which is larger than international FIFA grounds. Osman has described his technique in the Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology, which is quite simple if you follow the instructions properly.</p>\n<p>He elaborated his process in the journal and the first step is to dry the grain. Then a two-stage chemical and heat treatment procedure will be followed using phosphoric acid and potassium hydroxide wash. They are not only easily available but are available at a very low cost. In Osman’s words “both of which are very low-cost chemical solutions. This then leaves us with activated carbon and carbon nanotubes—high-value materials which are very much in demand.”</p>\n<p>The items that the UK usually imports from the Middle East, the US and beyond can now be procured from the local suppliers. Through this technique, the country can not only help the local suppliers but can also make sure that they reduce the emissions and create high-value products.</p>\n<p>Osman further explained, “Across the globe there is a real demand for carbon as it is used to create fuel for households, parts for water filters, and charcoal for barbecues. If we are able to take something that would otherwise be a waste and turn it into a useful biofuel, it can only be a good thing for our planet. It could really help to solve global waste and energy problems.”</p>\n<p>Osman believes that he could commercialize this method of developing a renewable source of energy from the leftover barley from breweries across the EU. Renewable source of energy, the process of reducing, recycle and reuse; and sustainable development is the need of the hour. Not only such low-cost techniques should be made to reduce waste generating, but more awareness should also be spread.</p>\n<p>Awareness about degradable and nondegradable things, also the importance of a clean and healthy environment in one’s life. People should now understand why it is high time to save our planet from the environment and climate change in order to survive.

Shudder.”</p>\n<p>Some are even concerned about the parenting of these eight characters. One of them sowed concern by saying, “Who looks after them tho? Teletubbies pop in, but they have their own stuff going on. Concerns abt childcare arrangements here.”</p>\n<p>Another one is still not sure if Teletubbies are the real parents. His tweet read, “Just wasted time figuring out which Teletubbies are the parents of which Tiddlytubbies.

We guess that’s the reason for it being the second best-selling video game franchise.</p>\n<p>Pokémon has given us some memories that have made a spot in our minds and science has proved that the spot is permanent. All those who have played Pokémon know the tricks and are experts in all the attacks that are special to the particular pocket monster. Guess where you have stored all this information? They have been allotted a region in your brain. Isn’t that extraordinary?</p>\n<p>The researchers discovered this spot after carrying out a test involving two groups of people. Obviously, one group had one who had Pokémon as a part of their lives since very long and the other set of people in this experiment were totally unaware of this universe containing such creatures.</p>\n<p>The experiment involved studying the brain of all these participants. They watched the activity of their brains when they displayed the pictures of 150 original characters in front of them. The researchers even showed them images of normal day-to-day things including cars and animals. They made an interesting observation from the scans.</p>\n<p>When the Pokémon trainers saw the photos of those creatures, the part of the brain known as the occipitotemporal sulcus got active. On the other hand, the other group of people who had never indulged in this world showed no signs of such activation in their brains on watching the Pokémon characters.</p>\n<p>Pikachu has stolen quite a few hearts with its electric power and also, the cute gestures. The thought of these characters is activating our occipitotemporal sulcus. Now, there’s a term for our excitement around Pokémon!</p>\n<p>The constant focus on this video game led to the formation of this region in the brains. We can tell that the parents are not happy with this addiction. However, this study shows no negative impact of the game on the minds of kids. So, parents can’t blame Pokémon (entirely!) for any changed behavior of their children.</p>\n<p>The research has given rise to a positive result in brain development. It reveals the special ability of our brain to build areas that are specific to a particular thing we are engaged in while growing up. This is true for all the activities we have done as kids. For the Mario Kart experts, that region is devoted to Mario.</p>\n<p>The researchers had already discovered this power of the brain when the grandmother cell came to be known. Okay, you might call it the “Jennifer Aniston neuron”. It is activated on the thought of a popular person and even when we see those famous faces.</p>\n<p>So, the Pokémon study is quite helpful to know the working of the brain and how it develops as children grow up. If it is capable of storing those creatures, it can definitely have space for informational stuff that would be in favor of them and their parents.</p>\n<p>Brains have secrets stored and the researchers are on the mission to reveal them gradually!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/your-brain-has-a-specific-region-dedicated-to-your-favorite-pokemon/\">Your Brain Has A Specific Region Dedicated To Your Favorite Pokémon</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>We all have been in the world of Charmander, Squirtle, Jigglypuff and so many more.

Combine this with a healthy dose of festive season stress for good measure. Whether it&#8217;s the pandemonium of having everyone under one roof, keeping the house tidy or the pressure of cooking, each can keep us from being our usual calm, well-rested selves. We thought it could be fun to explore how we might put some of these tensions to bed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>What is impressive about this high technology duvet is not the roller system it has in it but the remotely controlled self-making and self-cleaning system installed in it. But it has one drawback that it is just at the designing stage and not at the working stage. And it won&#8217;t be available in a short-run period. But the company CEO shared why this technology is important and essential in one’s life.</p>\n<p>He shared that, &#8220;When you sleep better, you are more likely to make better decisions, take less risks and start the day in a more positive and peaceful frame of mind. So, for those who can&#8217;t wait for a futuristic sleep solution like the Duvet Diplomat, Simba&#8217;s temperature-regulating Hybrid Duvet with space-inspired Stratos technology has everything you need to prevent sleepless nights this Christmas.&#8221; So one should invest in the high technology duvets for better sleep and better sleep to ensure a better lifestyle.

However, it’s hard to bring them out of the screen and into the real world. Do you see how positive we are, we say it’s hard but don’t tag the task as “impossible”.</p>\n<p>This optimistic approach towards them has led us to towards the invisibility shield that is now very real. Yes, the scientists have been successful in creating one and the credit goes to the Canadian camouflage company, HyperStealth Biotechnology Corp. and Guy Cramer who invented this Quantum Stealth as they call it.</p>\n<p>Of course, the creation involved a lot of research around the phenomenon related to light. This shield is made of a material that can bend light resulting in the vanishing of any object.</p>\n<p>The whole idea revolves around the concept of refractive index and how it is different for every matter. It is the comparison of the speed of light in that material to the speed of light in a vacuum. The light ray bends when it enters a material with a smaller or larger refractive index as compared to its original medium.</p>\n<p>Have you ever observed a spoon closely in a glass containing water? If you have then you are familiar with this bending of light. In case you haven’t then now would be a good time. So, the science here says that when light travels from one medium to another with varying refractive indices, it changes angle. If this technique is incorporated in some practical things, then invisibility comes into existence.</p>\n<p>This invention of the Quantum Stealth is bringing us closer to the magical universe. Guy Cramer, the inventor deserves appreciation for the incredible work in this field. He has made sure that the invention would not be accessible to the general public due to the negative utilization that may occur after its open availability.</p>\n<p>He is in conversation with the military organizations to make this “invisibility cloak” as per their requirements. They can use it to their benefit on the field.</p>\n<p>When any person or object is positioned behind it at a specific distance, it is no longer visible. Imagine witnessing this in real life! According to the company that brought this to life, this Quantum Stealth can conceal people, buildings and vehicles.</p>\n<p>The sheet would only serve military organizations and not reach the general public. The inventor has made it clear.</p>\n<p>The final creation is extremely thin and requires no power to operate. Also, there is no dependence on the season or time. Such qualities make it really convenient!</p>\n<p>So, “Potterheads”, here is one magic out of the series that you can watch in reality.

We are aware of the fact that the whole concept was based on the whims of the author. But even the sources belonging to this real world had helped her in forming this imagination.</p>\n<p>The Philosopher’s Stone shown in the story was not an original idea of the author. Even the stone’s maker, Nicholas Flamel was a real person. He was a landlord in medieval Paris who died in the year 1418. But soon after his death, an uncertain story about him began to circulate which described him as an alchemist who had discovered the Philosopher’s Stone. Nobody has a staunch proof of this theory or maybe, it was just made up by someone like us.</p>\n<p>The Ripley Scroll is a 16-century manuscript which is some six meter long. It depicts the procedure of making a stone and its name was derived from the name of a priest and alchemist, George Ripley who belonged to Bridlington Priory, East Yorks. But it is not so easy to understand and some images are also hidden in order to not express the meaning clearly. Even the Flamel’s grave cannot explain the secret which is put on show along with the Ripley Scroll in a library.</p>\n<p>The process of seeking information of the future may sound like something belonging to the whimsical world only. But it was actually a tradition in the previous century. The black moon crystal ball from 20th century was used by a witch from Paignton in Devon. Emma Watson’s character, Hermione Granger was an early Germanic writing system which was used in Old Norse, Old High German and Old English until the early 16th century.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_678\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-678\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-678\" src=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Real-crystal-ball.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Real-crystal-ball.jpg 600w, https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Real-crystal-ball-225x300.jpg 225w, https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Real-crystal-ball-315x420.jpg 315w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-678\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Imgur</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The hippogriff which is a cross between a bird and a horse was depicted in a picture which can be found in Historia Animalium which belongs to an Italian author named Idonius and it is from the year 1595.</p>\n<p>Harry Potter was shown riding the hippogriff but the picture shows a man running away from the creature. Another drawing of basilisk, a snake-like monster was already shown by Idonius. He described is as a creature with the width of a palm but capable of killing someone within seconds.</p>\n<p>Similarly, potion and spells were also used to cure ailments and make people fall in love. Even “Abracadabra” was believed to be a method to cure malaria. The names of some characters were also taken from the real names of the constellations.

So, the priest baptized her in the virtual reality and she was surprised and even cried because she didn’t think that it was possible to experience it in her life.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this baptism service is the priest’s vision to bring religious activities to the people who are unable to access them in reality.

Taking on that trail, a series named ‘Tuca and Bertie’ is weaving a similar kind of fascination among the viewers on Netflix.</p>\n<p>One would usually end up believing the genuineness of the characters of the series. The feathery creatures have played their part very well. It is not strange to find one linking its roots to the superhit series like SpongeBob. The writer has put every element of the bird kingdom with the human world. The feathery creatures donning their characteristics roam around to do chores of human life. Not just that, the series also provides a ground of inspiration for bird-lovers to step out of their homes with binoculars and look up for their genuine counterparts.</p>\n<p>It is easy to find the characteristics of Bertie in line with that of a song thrush. Its brown complexion with spots leaves behind the golden clue for the bird-lovers. This group has ensconced itself in the European land. Then Tuca’s appearance makes one go to the lanes where one could hear the Ramphastos family of toucans.</p>\n<p>Speckle turns up to spread its glitter. To ease the burden of the bird-lovers, it has already declared it to be the representative of robins in the series. Adding to that declaration, its yellow bill, red-breast and grey head aid the bird lovers to draw out its complete picture.</p>\n<p>Conde Nest presents a complete picture of the flock that also includes some flightless birds. There are a feral pigeon, a song thrush and a chickadee. Giving enough space to a chickadee, it has drawn out various characteristics of this group. Despite the diversity, the Conde Nest goes ahead to present all the birds in same shades. Thus, the bird-lovers have to make a great deal of efforts to distinguish them from each other.</p>\n<p>To make the heads of the bird-lovers go for a toss, Pastry Pete jumps up with all its might spreading pearls of rage. It does not signify its features in clear form. But its (physical) characters like beak shape, etc. connect it to penguins. Ebony and Sophie fly in to present their remarkable partnership. Their larger bills make them stand up with the ravens. But their size does not fall in line with that group.</p>\n<p>To spread some colors, a cocksure Dirk turns up. It plays Bertie’s boss (Holland) in the series. One would not be wrong in taking it up for a rooster or a mountain quail.</p>\n<p>Dakota enthralls the viewers with its sweet voice laying its resemblance with a canary. Not just that, there are many owls, a northern cardinal who goes up shoulder to shoulder with Speckle in series.</p>\n<p>Thus, the series is the treasure of birdie gems.

No doubt, the employees must have gone through a very stressful and difficult situation when they lost their jobs.</p>\n<p>Game Informer, a video game magazine has published a report which describes the several circumstances that led to the decline of this Gaming giant. It may sound something strange that a huge company like Telltale was falling, but there were a lot of things happening inside.</p>\n<p>The co-founder and former CEO of Telltale, Kevin Bruner told the publication that the huge success of the early seasons of The Walking Dead had already set a bigger challenge for them to maintain its popularity for the next seasons.</p>\n<p>To make the other seasons successful, they were not willing to shift their ideology away from the actual concept of the game. This also made them afraid to take any further risks. The criticisms threw light on the fact that most of the later games had a feeling of being closely associated with the previous ones.</p>\n<p>The company’s narrative designer, Emily Grace Buck informed about the misunderstandings and misinformation at several stages that caused the decline and also about the toxic culture inside the organization.</p>\n<p>If there were any huge and sudden transitions in the game at the last moment by another employee, Bruner would make working there a hard time for them, as said by Buck. Bruner also told the Game Informer that he always had to seek for a chance to make the game even better.</p>\n<p>They had to improve the content of the game in every way possible. As they did not have three-year-long production cycles, they had to do every improvement possible in a very short period.</p>\n<p>Apart from the other projects, they had to establish an environment to work on several major projects simultaneously which also led to a hard time for the whole development team. It became very difficult for them to maintain the same level of success in every release of a game rather than becoming popular for just one game and then vanish from the path of success.</p>\n<p>There might have been several other reasons that led to the closure and most of them are precisely described in this report.

They also believe that the border of our planet is surrounded by large walls of ice. That fact that is more bizarre is that there is a whole freakin’ society dedicated to this, I don’t know, something. That’s not even 10% of what theories they have. And now they have come up with an explanation regarding what Aurora AKA the northern and southern lights are.</p>\n<p>According to Science and our beloved Wikipedia, “Aurora Borealis (The Northern lights) and Aurora australis (The southern lights) is a natural light display in the earth’s sky, predominantly seen in the high latitude regions. They are the result of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by solar wind”. The various colors occur according to what the solar elements interact with and their movement depends on solar wind particle and magnetic field lines. Aurora lights are quite beautiful and a very popular tourist attraction.</p>\n<p>But if the earth would’ve been flat, there wouldn’t be a magnetic field to create the natural and colorful lights. So, here’s what causes Auroras according to the flat earthers:</p>\n<p>“Auroras are believed to be caused by charged high energy particles from the solar winds that are trapped within the magnetic field of the Earth. As these charged particles spiral back and forth along the lines of the magnetic field, they become visible nearest to the north and south magnetic poles where these magnetic lines become vertical and interact with the atmoplane of the Earth.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The bright visually pleasing colors commonly associated with auroras are the result of electrons colliding with oxygen and nitrogen molecules in the Earth&#8217;s atmoplane.

It means that the DC Comic world exists in Marvel Universe just as it does in our world. The way the hero told the fans is what grabbed everybody’s attention.</p>\n<p>It is also true that both the worlds have a separate fan base and both the worlds are equally successful. But the high time of the fans is when both the comics obliquely refers to the heroes of opposite sites. Not only it helps us get a kick out of it but it helps us with our imagination cross over in our heads.</p>\n<p>We all remember that in 2002’s Spider-Man there was a ‘Shazam’ joke and recently Deadpool 2 even name-checked the Distinguished Competition when the Merc with a Mouth told the grouchy Cable, “You’re so dark. Are you sure you’re not from the DC universe?” That was a burning moment for the cross overs. But apart from the cross over in the cinemas and our heads the thing to be focussed upon is that Iron Man himself agrees on the Superman being in Marvel.</p>\n<p>Well, one has to confirm it once they get hands-on the comic books and the digital download on June 19th. Well everybody is excited for Tony Stark: Iron Man #13 and to confirm what the hero claims are true. Well, some believe that cross overs are the most exciting thing but some believe that referencing DC is nothing new for Marvel, does that mean that Marvel refers to DC for their gain and personal kick.</p>\n<p>We all know that the ultimate goal is entertainment and money but then again saying anything and proving it is another thing. Well, we can just do the cross over in our heads, gossips and wait for the Tony Stark: Iron Man #13 till June 19th. Also, do some research about the co-existing worlds but then it is not in anybody’s hands but the writers how and what story they give you to read.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/iron-man-revealed-superman-exists-in-the-marvel-universe/\">Iron Man Revealed Superman Exists In The Marvel Universe</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>The hero said that “I am smart.

Conrad is a member of Ghost Gaming and a Twitch streamer who created a memory through his broadcast for a lifetime as he wanted to give his mom a late Christmas present.</p>\n<p>He is considered to be a Fortnite pro and he called his mom in-between the stream to let her know that he has helped her clear the student loans by using the money he earned through his broadcasts.</p>\n<p>His mom said that she didn’t want anything as her son has done enough of what she always wanted and Conrad replied to her back that it was “too late” to let him know the fact and he had already paid all his school loans. His mom refused to accept what he said as it wasn’t a federal loan and he couldn’t touch it.</p>\n<p>He later mentioned the name of the person, Lina who helped him make the payment. While he mentioned the name, his mom understood that for real, her son has cleared up the debt. Conrad told his mom that the people who were watching his stream at that moment had made it possible.</p>\n<p>We probably know that the student loan is not a new concept. It becomes hectic to take a huge amount and pay them later with high-interest rates. What Aydan Conrad did will make any parent proud of their child.</p>\n<p>It was an emotional moment when it happened and it left everyone in tears including Conrad and his mom. He has earned almost $160,000 as prize money to date through Fortnite only. He has approximately 1.4 million followers on Twitch and it shows that he earns a good amount through his streaming. We all long for the moment to come in the foreseeable future when we would earn a good amount of money and bring a beautiful smile on the cheerful face of our parents.</p>\n<p>Esports Earnings have informed that he has earned $50,000 at the Fortnite World Cup in the duos event.

However, the news wasn’t confirmed neither by Comcast, nor by Universal until the Philadelphia based cable giant Comcast Corp. executives announced the plan during their earnings call on January 23. The Nintendo world will be the ‘fourth’ park to be a part of Universal Orlando’s resort which already includes Universal Studios Florida, Volcano Bay water park and Islands of Adventure.</p>\n<p>During the call, the executives answered, “Nintendo, based on our research, is the biggest potential driver in attendance you can have in terms of intellectual properties”. The talks about opening the Nintendo world goes as far back as 2017, but mostly was kept hushed. It is now first opening this summer at Universal Studios Japan, who recently shared a peek on what can be expected from the theme park.</p>\n<p>The execs further added: “It’s up there with Harry Potter, and in some of our parks, HP drives incremental attendance of 2 million people.”The theme park will cost about $544 million, approximately $90 million more than they have spent on the The Wizarding World of Harry Potter- Dragon Alley.</p>\n<p>Super Nintendo World, in Orlando will be based on an area of 750 -acres, reportedly double the size from the Orlando resort. It will be a few short kilometres away from the original Universal Studios property.</p>\n<p>The following statement was made by the senior vice president and CCO, Thierry Coup:<br />\n“You’re not just playing a game, you’re living the adventure. Nintendo’s most iconic locations and experiences will be brought to life, including Mushroom Kingdom, Peach’s Castle, an incredible Mario Kart ride, Bowser’s Castle – and more.”</p>\n<p>The Super Nintendo World, which is home to some of the most iconic characters like Super Mario and Pokemon, is set to combine the real world and the virtual world of video games. Visitors would need to wear wristbands, called Power up bands through which they can collect digital coins, the same way Mario collects in the games.</p>\n<p>Not just for adventure and fun, the theme park would help the economy by increasing tourism and travel, as it’s expected that the Park will extract millions of video game geeks from all over the world. In addition to this, over 14000 jobs will be generated from this project, which will receive a starting minimum wage of $15 per hour, varying accordingly.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/super-nintendo-will-officially-open-at-universal-orlandos-new-theme-park/\">Super Nintendo Will Officially Open At Universal Orlando’s New Theme Park</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>The buzz was going on for quite a long time that Epic Universe would now introduce a Super Nintendo World.

The Sun&#8217;s surface in the image looks like a honeycomb.</p>\n<p>The telescope is located in the National Science Foundation (NSF) in the US and according to the astronomers; the telescope will guide us to discover several facts about the Sun and is a remarkable invention of the era. This will help us to solve several enigmas and the impact it has on our world.</p>\n<p>If we closely look into the picture produced, it shows gold cell-like structures which are approximately the size of Texas. These small structures are one of the factors that are responsible for the impulsive motions that carry heat from the Sun’s inner core to its surface.</p>\n<p>As told by Mihalis Mathioudakis, the professor of the Queen’s University Belfast and one of the contributors in developing the high-resolution camera for the telescope, the clear and the most detailed images of the Sun produced will now help us to explore new horizons in solar physics. It will also help us to comprehend properly the physical processes occurring at the surface of the Sun which wasn’t known yet and with such details which were not possible to obtain till now.</p>\n<p>France Cordova, the director of NSF told that the Inouye Solar Telescope will allow us to locate the magnetic fields inside the Sun’s corona, the place responsible for solar eruptions. This benefit expands to improving our conceptions of the factors that affect the weather of the space.</p>\n<p>This will help the weather forecasters to properly predict the solar storms and the alert would provide more time for the utility companies and the government to ensure safety for the power grids, infrastructure and protect active satellites from the solar storms.</p>\n<p>Matt Mountain, president of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, further added to this discussion that the Telescope will help to predict the specific place on the entire Earth where there is a sure chance of rain which is still outside the scope of space weather.</p>\n<p>He further added that we lag behind terrestrial weather by almost half of a century and this demands more study on space weather directing our focus to the Sun. The process would take a lot of time but it is eventually possible with the Inouye Solar Telescope.</p>\n<p>This telescope will also work with the NASA’s Parker Solar Probe and European Space Agency’s Solar Orbiter, which is yet to be launched, to help us in the field of solar research in the best way.

Now some of us might have been thinking that all Disney-related movies will always be available on this platform but some of them are being removed now.</p>\n<p>This thought didn’t inculcate in our mind on its own because Disney had already told Comicbook about the same in November during the launch that the movies and shows will be permanently added as the Disney+ spokesperson said that there will not be a “rotating slate” of the licensed movies every month, unlike Hulu or Netflix. He further added that the beloved classics such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, Cinderella, The Jungle Book, The Lion King will be available from the first day of the launch.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this has proved to be so wrong now as some movies have already disappeared from the service in just two months after the launch. So, what’s the reason behind the abdication? Let&#8217;s look at the report from Julia Alexander which shows that some of the Disney movies have run into the pandemonium due to the various legacy licensing deals but these movies are to be permanently added to Disney+ as soon as their license with the other parties expires.</p>\n<p>Although, it is not a matter of surprise for the users of these streaming services to see some of the movies and shows being removed. But other streaming platforms such as Netflix and Hulu would at least inform the users about the updates related to their content.</p>\n<p>Here, Disney+ didn’t do the same and the removal of the shows was a mere surprise for everyone. Now, it is unclear when the Home Alone series would reappear on Disney+ and there’s no surety for other movies as well. According to Bloomberg’s report, Disney movies like Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Coco are expected to return to Netflix around 2026.</p>\n<p>This is a sign that the above-listed movies might not be available on Disney+ from 2026 as per the deal between Disney and Netflix. Disney&#8217;s spokesperson further added: “Disney+ has the unique position of having a deep library of high-quality content across multiple premium brands, as well as a robust pipeline from its internal film and TV studios.”</p>\n<p>The upshot of the whole story says that we cannot expect every movie owned by Disney to be available on Disney+ all the time. They are not likely to stay forever due to the legacy licensing issues. So, it would be better for the users to look for the movies of their choice and watch them soon because nobody knows if they are going to be always available to watch or not.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/movies-have-been-disappearing-from-disney-since-january/\">Movies Have Been Disappearing From Disney+ Since January</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>The perfect example of this removal is the Home Alone series which were available during the prior launch of Disney+ but the first two parts Home Alone and Home Alone 2: Lost in New York had been recently removed on the New Year’s Eve.

He told that these companies like Sony and Nintendo are not really in the league now and so many factors are instrumental for the above said.</p>\n<p>They could try to upgrade their cloud computing services like Microsoft’s Azure, but Microsoft has already put a lot of effort into their cloud services in the past few years.

Last year, you might have heard that this company had also partnered with Sony to help it in using Azure.

His statement caused him a lot of heat and backlash from his listeners and social media. He had to then go onto Twitter to clear his stance. He explained that he didn&#8217;t mean to say that video games should avoid politics at all, but rather wanted to say that games that tackle politics should do so from a creative perspective, rather than a marketing one. Further elaborating, he said that the game platforms themselves should be “operating as neutral venues for entertainment and employees, customers —and everybody else could hold their own views and not be judged by the company for that”.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here’s one of the key views I shared at DICE.

There’s no reason to drag divisive topics like that into gaming.

Video companies as companies need to divorce themselves from politics and that the platforms should be neutral.”</p>\n<p>Apart from this hot gossip, his speech touched many other hot topics like the marketing tie-ins which says that if a company has an awesome new product, it starts releasing free stuff in games and people get engaged with it. Loot boxes, at which he raised the question of do we want to be like Las Vegas, with slot machines &#8230; or do we want to be widely respected as creators of products that customers can trust? Thereafter, he discussed the cross-platform games where he explained that the companies really need to accept equal access to all customers and give up their attempts to create their own private wall guard or private monopoly. In the end, he talked about privacy, blaming Google and Facebook for offering free services that customers pay for with a “loss of privacy and loss of freedom”.</p>\n<p>Sweeney&#8217;s viewpoints seem to be pretty scattered and also very unclear. He wants creatives to be allowed to make political games but that game companies that publish and distribute those games be politically neutral. The level of neutrality he talks about does fit in line with Epic’s past history when it comes to political issues.</p>\n<p>Epic Games as a company says that it supports players and content creators in speaking out, but won’t go as far as to actually stand up for any particular issue after all, that might alienate people of a particular political or social view, and offend a person’s personal opinion.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/videos-and-politics-should-remain-separate-says-epic-games-ceo-tim-sweeney/\">Videos And Politics Should Remain Separate Says Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Tim Sweeney is the CEO of Epic Games, the company which made the ever smashing and successful game Fortnite.

The company also offered to replace the batteries of such phones for $79 which was later reduced to a more affordable price of $29 for its customers in January 2018.</p>\n<p>The US District Court came up with a decision and stated that Apple would have to pay $25 to each iPhone user who has the affected model. All the iPhone users in the United States, owning the iPhone 6, 6 plus, 6S, 6S plus, 7, 7 plus or SE are entitled to a payment of $25, if they bought any of these devices before 21st December 2017. The total amount to be paid by this global tech company lies in the range of $310 million and $500 million. The approval of this settlement is still pending and the judge will look into this subject on 3rd April.</p>\n<p>Last month, France’s consumer watchdog, the Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Prevention, also charged Apple with a heavy fine of €25 million for the same issue. They said that the iPhone users were not informed earlier that if they installed the iOs update, 10.2.1 and 11.2, it would slow down their devices. It was considered a crime of ‘deceptive commercial practice by omission’ by DGCCRF. To this Apple admitted that they slowed down its older devices but, they also claimed that they did so to extend the life of such phones.</p>\n<p>When this news initially came to light in 2017, tech blog geekbench.com did its own research in the whole matter. Their blog read: “First, it appears that the problem is widespread, and will only get worse as phones and their batteries continue to age. Second, the problem is due, in part, to a change in iOs. The difference between 10.2.0 and 10.2.1. is too abrupt to be just a function of battery function. I believe that Apple introduced the change to limit performance when battery condition decreases past a certain point. Why did Apple do this?”</p>\n<p>iPhone users all around the world were annoyed by this strategic tactic adopted by Apple. They felt that the company just wanted to take more money from their loyal customers. One of the annoyed iPhone users Tweeted, “Been saying this since the original iPhone, as soon as that started to inexplicably slow down, I switched to android. Glad I did, Apple drain our money. They come over here, make huge profits and don’t pay fair share of tax, then it turns out they were screwing peeps. Nah.”</p>\n<p>With such hefty fines and complaints from its customers, Apple hopefully learnt the lesson.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/apple-agreed-to-pay-500-million-as-settlement-for-slowing-down-iphones/\">Apple Agreed To Pay $500 Million As Settlement For Slowing Down iPhones</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>In defense to these accusations, in December 2017, Apple confirmed that the company does slow down some models with time but it was done keeping in mind the battery performance of these phones which gets reduced over time.

Aydan took this opportunity and called his mother, in front of his followers, and told her how he has paid off her students’ loan and cleared her debts. Her mother was in a state of shock and could not believe it at first. After acknowledging the fact that her debt has been cleared, she began to cry in gratitude. She thanked the viewers of the live stream and also told them to subscribe to the game. She was truly touched by how his son cleared her debts by just playing a game live. She encouraged the viewers and also thanked them for their support.

Sadly, Logan, Jackman’s role name which he played through 17 years and 9 movies, was the last series in which we saw Wolverine, as he now thinks it’s time to retire from the role.</p>\n<p>Reasoning about the fact, Jackman told that he was inspired to take this step from Jerry Seinfeld, who reasoned to him why he retired from his iconic series ‘Seinfeld’.</p>\n<p>He said, “Jerry said, ‘I’ve always believed, you should spend everything creatively because it’s almost Herculean to start up again. You should always have something in the tank.’”</p>\n<p>Talking to MTV Jackman said, “When I saw Deadpool, I was like, wow that’s cool. It’s just a matter of time. It’s a bit like you’re at the greatest party you’ve ever been at, you’ve been dancing for an hour and a half, and then you’re just like ‘It’s time, OK. If I stay any longer, it’s gonna get ugly.’ It’s like, it’s time.”</p>\n<p>“And on the way home, someone calls you and goes, ‘They just put Michael Jackson on, you gotta get back here. And a little part of you goes ‘I like Michael Jackson,’ but then you just go, I want to go to bed.”</p>\n<p>As saddening the statement is, we know where he is coming from. However, what is not saddening is that Jackman is open to the Idea of playing any other role, be it a normal or a superhero role.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wolverine-hugh-jackman-addressed-his-part-as-the-role-of-a-lifetime/\">‘Wolverine’ Hugh Jackman Addressed His Part As ‘The Role Of A Lifetime’.</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Hugh Jackman had been a part of X-men since 2000, with the series debuting in the same year with a hit.

They are using their talents to soothe the atmosphere with their campaigns. Adding to this sphere of isolation activities, an artist named Josh Gad has come up with amazing some bed-times stories.</p>\n<p>Basking in the fame for voicing the little snowman-Olaf of “Frozen” movie, the artist has made a mark across the globe. He is all back on the floor but in a changing way. With people locking themselves in their house to banish the life-wreaking corona virus, the need for the stress-relieving activities has also gone up. Taking note of the intense situation, the actor has gone ahead to take up some bed-time stories.</p>\n<p>Taking to the Twitter world on March 13, the artist announced his intentions to start bed-story sessions to relieve the isolated world. After getting done with the formality of promulgation, the artist has ensured to turn up every night at 7:30 p.m. on his Twitter account with a bed-time storybook. The story-telling spree goes on for around 10 minutes with the actor taking on the words with his creative voice. Owing to the success of the initiative, his fans have huddled together (virtually) to make his story fan club named “#GadBookClub”.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/ijZeFccTF3\">https://t.co/ijZeFccTF3</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Josh Gad (@joshgad) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshgad/status/1238629615389691904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 14, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>The artist has managed to add a new charm to the tales dating back to the good old-times by putting in the magic of his creative voice.</p>\n<p>His “Olivia Goes to Venice” (by Ian Falconer) session has rocked the world of story lovers.

Souls around the locked globe have come up bubbling on the social media platform to express their gratitude to the artist for his concern. One of them-Jillian Brunson said, “We LOVE this. Thank you thank you thank you from children ages 3,5, 32 &amp; 33”.</p>\n<p>Some of the fans went a step ahead to share their family pictures in which they posed to reflect on their bed-time story moments during Josh’s live show.</p>\n<p>Sharing the news of his Twitter bed-time story session, the artist said, “So, since we’re all stuck at home right now I figured we’d have a little fun together,” he told his fans during the live stream.

The real idea belongs to tow students who have sworn to make people abide by the laws of lockdown. This, in turn, would be fruitful in curbing the spread of coronavirus. After all, what better way to keep millennials away from the need for social interaction than the revelation of spoilers from their favorite series. Both Seine Kongruangkit along with Matithorn Prachuabmoh Chaimoungkalo nicknamed as ‘Brave, are a duo who both go to the Miami Ad School in Deutschland.</p>\n<p>On returning to their native nation, Thailand, they were stunned at the levels of ignorance towards the rules of social distancing. And so they decided to take charge of the matter. Brave the recent copywriting graduate from the institutes&#8217; branch in Hamburg in the interview with LADbible revealed that he was called on a mission to collaborate on communicating the idea and concept of social distancing and self-isolation to the community. Besides this, he was also supposed to educate people on how staying indoors is the best thing we can do on our parts to combat COVID-19. Seine who studies Art Direction from the Berlin branch of the school joined hands with his partner a day later.</p>\n<p>The two quickly got to work and decided to flatten the curve once and for all. In an interview, Seine mentioned that it was not possible to force people to stay indoors. Man is a social animal and needs interaction and fresh air from time to time and so it is obvious that they could not use regular ways. In such a situation where people are not taking the authorities seriously, only one thing came to their mind, something that will motivate people to stay indoors.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_921\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-921\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-921\" src=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/New-Project-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/New-Project-6.jpg 600w, https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/New-Project-6-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-921\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Imgur</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Post Brave’s invitation to save Thailand, Seine came up with the brilliant idea of putting up spoilers posters all across the known land compelling the millennials to stick indoors, because duh! According to Brave, the reluctance to stay indoors during this phase of a pandemic has to be understood individual cases. Some are forced to leave their homes every day because the course of nature demands them to- including the daily wage workers, etc. But the idea is for those who can avoid social gatherings for some time- the millennials and the youngsters. Additionally, he also believes that the current generation lacks the discipline that the older generations hold.</p>\n<p>And that is exactly why the idea is perfect. Because nothing bothers a youngster more than a spoiler. The team also pitched the idea to Netflix, who refused the same.

Samuel Tacchi, the designer of Lego’s first Technic, speaking of the big launch said that the company has partnered with Universal Studios for the same.</p>\n<p>Tacchi has worked in close proximity to the team and makers of the film to get everything right. He wishes to bring life to the vehicle in as perfect ways as possible. And thus, he has worked super hard on minutest of the details. The toy car would be priced at about a hundred dollars and will be an exact replica of the one in the movie. Its bonnet would be opened by the charger to reveal its V8 quality engine, whilst its trunk would hold nitro bottles at the back. Apart from all this, there are also fire extinguishers that have been added to its front.</p>\n<p>The car is a blessing to the ones who are a die-hard fan of the movie series but probably play no role in satisfying people who do not follow the franchise. And even though the manufacturing is still going on, one can place an advance order and book their gizmo. In a recent update, LEGO delayed the launch of the product due to the sudden lockdown in the country, and fans are definitely not thrilled. Last year during Christmas time the toy-making giants introduced an old school Batman toy, which took many down the nostalgia lane. And of course, it is nothing else than the 3306 pieces set of Michael Keaton’s Batmobile.</p>\n<p>This set consists of three figurines apart from the batmobile- Joker, Vicki Vale, and Batman. All these characters belong to the 1989 motion picture and there is no question that Lego has worked tirelessly to get things right. The launch was to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the film series. But sadly, not everyone gets to have an edition. The set is priced at a high amount of 399 dollars and cannot be afforded by many.</p>\n<p>Coming back to their current project, Dominic Toretto’s is all set to hit the market on April 27th.

The family includes Mum Steph aged 36 and dad Matt aged 37. While Eight-year-old Edith, seven-year-old Arthur and the little baby Olive make up the team of three junior Taylors. The fabulous five found the lockdown boredom unbearable and thus, they decided to create some interesting stuff from whatever they had at home. They used homemade costumes, self-made props and face paints to dress up as their favorite movie character. The family then posed like the film scenes and captured their recreation.</p>\n<p>The ‘guess the movie’ game was initially just for their friends and relatives but soon they decided to make it open for anyone interested in having a little time off the boredom. Taylors created an Instagram account with the user name ‘Guess The Movie’, where the bio made the fellow users aware of the purpose of the account. Their quirky idea was very well accepted by people and proved to be an absolute hit. Looking at the immense response, the Taylors started posting fresh challenges every day.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-l2gdflo_K/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Guess the movie’. All five members of the family showed full-blown enthusiasm to keep their viewers engaged with them. In fact, their audience always keeps an eye for their new posts and tries to be the first one to crack the new movie challenge.</p>\n<p>Some of the best captures included the two junior Taylors, Edith and Arthur wearing a helmet and enacting the famous movie Dumb and Dumber. The brother sister duo also got clicked recreating the classic musical romance movie, La La Land. The little lady got dressed in yellow giving a tough competition to Emma Stones and the tiny boy won our hearts by mimicking Ryan Gosling. Daddy Taylor then joined the two kids to depict Bohemian Rhapsody.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-m7ADblqpF/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

He is not willing to do the series James Gunn is looking forward to. He said that playing a role would be difficult with all the fuss of makeup and everything.</p>\n<p>We could understand his perspective and issues. But if we assume by seeing one of the Marvel shows like The Wanda Vision, we can conclude that one season’s time duration is more or less close to the duration of the movie.</p>\n<p>If the duration of one season is close to the duration of the movie then we can hope that Bautista can be convinced of the show given the fact that the storyline is nice. And of course, if it will be in the guidance of James Gunn.</p>\n<p>The storyline of Drax and Mantis could go at great lengths. The possibilities of the movie are infinity. The story could go from one end to another. One of the best storylines could be Drax meeting his long-lost daughter, Moondragon. Although their relationship is not explained properly in the comics. But Marvel Studios has the habit of twisting and turning the stories for more action.</p>\n<p>One of the storylines could also be Drax meeting his wife. Drax has been married to one of the former avengers popularly known as Swordsman. She is yet to appear in any of the Marvel movies. Her cameo can be a mode of excitement for fans. Nonetheless, Mantis also has a very wild comic history. We could rely on her comic stories as well for a better movie.</p>\n<p>Optimistically, this idea of Drax and Mantis gets above the concept.

Leon Oostrum who works at the Netherland Institute for Radio Astronomy said the signal was not from an alien beacon. And if it was from one, it would emit more quickly. A 16-day period is not efficient for communication. It would have taken forever to get one message at a speed of one signal every 16 days. This proved that there would be no real-life alien invasion.</p>\n<p>But knowing that the signal was not from aliens didn&#8217;t make this any less significant moment for the astrophysicist who noticed the pattern. He noticed these figures from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment radio telescope in British Columbia.</p>\n<p>Researchers have so far found over 100 types of fast radio bursts. But only 10 of those were seen to repeat the cycle. None of those signals had shown any consistent tempo. It was first of its kind. The fast radio bursts were emitted for one or two times per hour for the next four days. Then completely went silent for the next 12 days. These have been tacked to a spiral galaxy 500 million light-years from our planet.</p>\n<p>An Astrophysicist at West Virginia University, Duncan Lorimer told about this significant discovery. To get to the bottom of these repeaters was going to take them in an interesting direction.</p>\n<p>One theory out of all the others made more sense that radio bursts orbited something else like a star or black hole. Other than this there was a probability of stellar winds that might have been boasting or blocking the radio pulse in certain intervals. This cycle of 16 days, had a potential that it could have led to more repeated transmission of a similar kind.</p>\n<p>Further, Lorimer explained that they detected periodicity on that one, hinted that there might be periodicity for others too. They went through the archived data from 2007, when he and his student David Narkevic discovered first FRB.</p>\n<p>The Exact origin and cause were not determined. But they believed that these FRB were from outside of the Milky Way. So researchers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics could use it to study the structure and evolution of space.</p>\n<p>Space is as wide as one can think so anything we notice leads to discoveries. Just like these signals from nowhere. All the scientists who have their research related to space want to get to the roots of cause, anytime.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/repeated-radio-signals-transmitted-to-earth-left-the-scientists-amazed/\">Repeated Radio Signals Transmitted To Earth Left The Scientists Amazed</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>There was nothing to be excited about because the scientists have been ruling out the potential for alien contact.

Pally, who is known for his comic roles in the television series like Happy Ending and The Mindy Project, said that it was after he first punched Baby Yoda in the face that he was told by the showrunner, Jon Favreau, that the hero prop for the character, which is the main puppet used to portray Baby Yoda on screen, cost around $5 million.

They called ‘Cut!’ and Jon who was watching on a monitor in his office, he came down from his office and said, “I just want to let you know that this is the hero Yoda and it costs, like, $5 million.”” Jon Favreau said that to Pally so that he kept this bit of information at the back of his head while acting. It was also because Pally fired off his subsequent straight rights into the adorable Force-user’s face. Pally also added that it made him so nervous that he missed three times in a row before nailing the action.</p>\n<p>The legendary director Werner Herzog, who play the role of the Client in the Disney+ series, called the puppet hero Baby Yoda ‘a phenomenal technological achievement’, so the $5 million price should not come as a surprise. Such heavy cost is also because of the fact that the puppet requires two technicians to operate. One technician operates the eyes and the mouth, while the other technician operates the puppet’s facial expressions. Herzog also added that he was smitten with the puppet and referred it to as ‘heartbreakingly beautiful’. His eyes would get filled with tears whenever he saw it.</p>\n<p>It was also because of Herzog that the Baby Yoda puppet was used extensively throughout the first season of The Mandalorian. We should thank him for that. The production team, behind the series, were told by Herzog that they were cowards for considering a CGI backup plan in case the puppet didn’t work out well. Not only it would have been harsh to use a CGI version of Baby Yoda, it would have been a relatively timid move and also a waste of some serious Calamari Flan.</p>\n<p>But the question is what do the viewers think about the Child puppet’s cost and whether the hero prop is worth $5 Million?</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/the-price-of-baby-yoda-puppet-from-the-mandalorian-is-just-5-million/\">The Price Of Baby Yoda Puppet From The Mandalorian Is Just $5 Million</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Adam Pally played the role of Bike Scout Trooper #2 in The Mandalorian’s eighth episode.

Her family put in a lot of effort to pull it off. We can see that clearly in the video. Even their dog did its part. The creativity of the video leads it to get viral. Though there is a part which we do not recommend you. The video just to give the ride feels has a part of a drop. This drop is from the stairs. We strongly recommend you not to try it at home.

Even after much work was done, still there was some scope of working on this situation. The game creators had launched some new guidelines and tough measures for the players. These rules were to be implemented then and were expected to show a great increase in cheaters players getting detected.</p>\n<p>In a post shared on Twitter, Infinity Wards confirmed that from that week onwards any player who would be reported as a suspected cheater would receive confirmation of getting banned from playing the game. The studio also implemented &#8220;additional dedicated security updates&#8221; which helped in the matchmaking so that the suspected cheaters had to play together.

The next day the numbers rose to 7000, damaging 88% of all the active players who were online. This virus reduces the game achievement statistics and also causes a debuff in movement and speed. There are total of 3.5 million user ids on Elysium.

And although he knew the risks involved and the panic he would create, he felt it was important given the fact that thousands of people are succumbing to it regularly. It had to be a hundred percent education without taking the wrong road of perception by the users.</p>\n<p>Once the lesson was imparted the players were given items such as virtual soaps and were tested on races as to who reaches home first, the virus was then removed when everybody learned the valuable lessons of hygiene and social distancing.

Now, we all know how this classic role-playing game has taken the gaming world by storm. This interview was organized by hosts of the IGN and they had interrogated Tom Holland if he had played the game before.</p>\n<p>It turned out that he didn’t but he had been planning to set up a team for Dungeons &amp; Dragons team along with Chris Pratt. Holland added that he would like getting it filmed instead of opting for the live stream.</p>\n<p>Well, we can proceed with his plan, therefore, devising our ideas to bring this imagination into reality. First comes the choice of the gamebook that would be used. Then comes the assignation of the class to the casts of Avengers.</p>\n<p>For the Cleric class, Chris Hemsworth as Thor is the most appropriate candidate whereas Scarlett Johansson is the one who’s fit for the Fighter class. Jeremy Renner as Ranger because he is the one out there with the bows and arrows and it will be more amazing if Pratt becomes the Rogue. Tom Holland seems like the game master and Benedict Cumberbatch will probably be the best to take on the role of the mantle of Wizard.</p>\n<p>Other than the D&amp;D, there are other gamebooks under Disney brand which can be preferred for the role. The same was done recently by the DC universe who had recalled their old DC Comics gamebook.</p>\n<p>The RPG game was headed by Sam Witwer and Freddie Prinze Jr. Also, several role-playing games belonging to MCU like Spider-Man, Hulk, Captain America, Daredevil, and the X-Men are there to amaze you.

However, many celebrities, organizations, and famous personalities are taking upon themselves to teach us about its importance and keeping us engaged while at it. Luckily, Minecraft is one of them.</p>\n<p>Their new simulator allows its gamers to experiment with different social distancing methods which can help them to protect villagers from other infected zombie villagers. Created by design and innovation company AKQA and Mojang, the Microsoft-owned Swedish developer, the game is available to download for free for its Java Edition. Hence, no console versions.</p>\n<p>Initially formulated by AKQA, the idea was later presented to Mojang, and thereafter it was partnered up with sustainability group Heart17 and the UNDP. Before the release, Mojang disclosed that it would partner with 2 organizations to help teach people about social distancing, using Minecraft.</p>\n<p>Joseph, co-creator of Blockdown explains, “We felt compelled to use our skills to make social distancing models accessible to everyone, especially younger audiences who might be confused about the new reality we are living. As a partner to Mojang and Heart17, we felt this was a fertile ground to speak about this issue to new audiences.”</p>\n<p>You can play the ‘Blockdown’ simulator either as an observer or a nurse. The game has two levels and there are three possible lockdown scenarios: free-for-all, Quarantine, and full lockdown. The first level consists of a village and a tower that has various mechanisms to mimic the inception of a virus. Their official blog post states: “By toggling between different variables in the control tower, players can observe how quickly Villagers can turn into Zombie Villagers.” Another level includes a hospital used to cure the Villagers. It even has a ZICU, short for Zombie Intensive Care Unit.</p>\n<p>Hugo Barnes, another Co-Creator describes the levels adding, “We really wanted to make this to make a stark contrast between the society level and the hospital level, and also the nice parallel between how every society is held up by its healthcare system. So, we kind of wanted to bake that observation into the map itself.</p>\n<p>Setting an example, the agency didn’t put any form of publicity to promote the map so as to avoid being noticed as making capital out of the situation and added that they didn’t want it to be like a corporate move.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/minecrafts-new-simulator-instills-the-importance-of-social-distancing/\">Minecraft’s New Simulator Instills The Importance Of Social Distancing</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>With the world currently battling a pandemic and isn’t in no mood for slowing down, social distancing is now becoming the norm.

From Cinderella to mermaid to Princess Fiona everyone is looking amazing. The photographer shared her experience with the Insider and told that she wanted all the mothers to experience what a happily ever after feels like. She wanted the mothers to feel what the Disney movies feel like after the ending. The photographer is herself a mother of two and shared “I thought, this must be what happens after ‘happily ever after.’”</p>\n<p>The photographer got the inspiration for her themed photo shoots after she did a photo shoot of a custom made maternity dress by Amada Mae. The custom made dress was made for the Disney character Belle. The dress was made during the release of the film ‘Beauty and the Beast’ which was released in 2017.</p>\n<p>Vanessa feels and believes that Disney princesses and characters are the best way to celebrate the mother’s pregnancy and new journey. She shared that she believes mothers are “a great inspiration to children in the world.” After sharing her pictures from the photo shoots, the pictures went viral in no time. People loved the theme and the whole idea behind the photo shoots.</p>\n<p>Vanessa shared “It is very fun and pleasurable to see someone transform into a princess and I often think about how it will be written in family history.” She further shared with Good Morning America that “These photos tell mothers that they can all be whoever they want to be.” After the portraits shared by Vanessa, one can no longer say that pregnancy photo shoots are predictable and usual.</p>\n<p>Pregnancy itself is a very fascinating process and now even the photo shoots are amazing. This new theme has for sure added more color and life to the pregnancy photo shoots. The smile on the mother’s faces is enough to tell how happy and delightful they are. More power and happiness to these and all the other expecting and soon to be mothers.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/photographer-transforms-mothers-into-disney-princesses/\">Photographer Transforms Mothers Into Disney Princesses</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Pregnancy is not only about creating a new life and giving birth.

Well, it is possible now because a new Instagram filter lets you make your dream come true. Moreover, it has also been created by someone (a fan) who loved playing this game. So, don’t assume if it’s been an official release from the Electronic Arts. Recently, The Sims franchise had completed its 20 years. On this occasion, a new Instagram filter has been introduced to provide the same effect.</p>\n<p>Plus, there will be a green diamond present above your head that makes you look more like a real Sim. The filter would smoothen your face, adds CGI lips along with the bold and angular eyebrows- the same way as a Sim looks like. So, how to get The Sims filter on Instagram? Open up your Instagram and then wander through the Stories camera viewfinder. Keep scrolling along with the lenses/ filters till the end. If you couldn’t find the filter, then open the Search function and then search for “The Sims”.</p>\n<p>Now keep scrolling down until you get “The Sims by tomer_haruvi” and then you’re good to go. Also, if you find it hard to locate it and you’ve seen your friends using it already, then go into their Stories and you’ll get to see the filter name at the top of the screen.

Snoopy had a very strong imagination and had imaginary World War scenarios which he made up in his mind. He would fight these wars and all the other characters would participate in Snoopy&#8217;s imaginary World War I exploits during the strip&#8217;s run, including Woodstock and his bird friends and Snoopy&#8217;s siblings, Belle and Spike.</p>\n<p>OddityMall is the company that picked up on this fictional character in a real-life drone version, which was first seen on YouTube in 2015. Years later it has been rediscovered and popularized by the Peanut’s advent fans. If anyone misses him flying across deserts with his WWI fighter pilot goggles from a few dozen feet up, now is your chance.

This is a company that aims to be “the best provider of aerial images worldwide.” Otto Dieffenbach, the company’s Marketing and Events Director has posted numerous videos of the flying characters Flyguy has created, including, among many, many others: Donald Trump, Superman, R2D2, the Green Lantern, Iron Man, and even Guillermo from Jimmy Kimmel. The company along with the regular Snoopy has the ‘Night-fit’ version of the same. The night version is fitted with an array of decorative lights that might even make it visible from Pluto. This version of the Snoopy Drone IRL is the one that you wish would deliver your children all of their gifts on Christmas. No Kidding!!</p>\n<p>All those who have been wonderstruck by this creation, FlyGuy has both a good and bad news for you. The good news is that the company still sells the complete set and the bad news is that it is sold at a retail price of $700. The company does say that it provides its customer with all the electronics, hope the drone is also included in it. Plus, flying ace Snoopy is relatively cheap compared to the $1,850 Flying Witch. Though the Flying Witch allows you to customize any person&#8217;s face on it. Which honestly is pretty dope.</p>\n<p>We never know where innovation will take us. We might have even more of the iconic characters being formed into drones in the near future. We just might see Oswald, Bob- the builder and other fictional characters flying in the sky soon enough.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/snoopy-from-peanuts-just-got-drone-treatment/\">Snoopy From Peanuts Just Got Drone Treatment</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Snoopy&#8217;s first appearance as World War I Flying Ace was in the Peanuts comic strip from October 10, 1965, which saw him climb on top of his dog house (claiming it was a Sop with Camel biplane) to do battle with the Red Baron.

The hospital staff was busy in carrying out their professional obligations. Suddenly, a being donning a vibrant costume took on the windows of the hospital.

The latest innovation is the formation of a human heart. This human heart is made by using soft artificial muscles and sensors and then coated in lab-grown human tissue. A highly scientific and futuristic technique.</p>\n<p>This groundbreaking innovation is named as the ‘HybridHeart’ which was made by Dutch scientists in the Amsterdam University Medical Centre (UMC). The scientists are eager to bring it into human use and aim on trying it on animals within three years. And put one inside a human by 2028. The lead researcher on this project Professor Jolanda Kluin said that there is a need for radical new solutions. The scientific community is decades away from building a living heart from a patient&#8217;s own cells if they will ever be able to do it is in question.</p>\n<p>Talking about the inspiration, the researcher said that some three years ago she saw a picture in a Dutch newspaper. The picture was of a soft robotic starfish, and it could move and swim like a living starfish. That is when the inspiration struck her. She saw the potential for merging the benefits of biology with the power of soft robotics, for a hybrid heart, for the first-ever solution for end-stage heart failure. On the technique, she explains that soft robotic artificial cardiac muscles precisely mimic the human heart, so the hybrid heart really beats like a real heart. And it is lined by the patient&#8217;s own cells preventing clotting, infection, and reaction. The energy transfer is wireless so that the patient experiences real freedom.</p>\n<p>Personal experience and loss the reasons that motivated the professor to take the chances and work on the project. Having lost her father to a heart failure, her efforts doubled, lest some other families go through the same pain and trauma of losing someone dear. It was hard to see her father knowing that there was nothing doctors could do.</p>\n<p>The project is getting more and more recognition worldwide. The cyber heart is one of four projects that has been shortlisted to win £30 million ($39m) in funding from the British Heart Foundation. Along with that, we have various other projects who aim to do the same, or along the same lines as the worldwide initiative, called the Big Beat Challenge. It was set to try and find &#8216;transformational solutions to tackle the world&#8217;s biggest killer&#8217;.

The only thing that made him different from other kids was the hair of the 50-year old bloke on his back.</p>\n<p>Jonathan’s parents Anthony Lopez, 28 and Nancy Rivera, 26 was pleasantly surprised by seeing the baby. The baby has thick hair on his arms, legs, back, and shoulders. He started to grow a beard as well. Seeing his growth of hair, Anthony called him mini wolverine.</p>\n<p>Jonathan was the topic of discussion in the hospital and among his family members. People were making fun of him. Some said that he will start shaving before walking. Many of them were joking about him being a grown-up man. The nurses said that he would be able to keep himself warm in winters just like animals do.</p>\n<p>The reason for this occurrence wasn’t known to the couple. In the ultrasound, they were able to differentiate between the gender of the baby. The hair was not shown in the ultrasound mainly because the machine was not a 4-D one.</p>\n<p>One more supernatural thing happened during Jonathan’s birth. He was born in the amniotic sac. The sac didn’t break before the birth. This is a very infrequent occurrence. Because of its unique feature, this phenomenon is considered lucky in some cultures. As we all know, people have the habit of linking every unique thing to supernatural activity.</p>\n<p>Nurses have informed Anthony and Nancy that hair will shed during bathing. This indicates that Jonathan will not be able to keep this power for long. He will lose his hair and his werewolf ability eventually.</p>\n<p>As per an article in Today’s Parent, this kind of soft, downy hair on a newborn is known as “lanugo” which is pronounced as ‘la-NOO-go’. This kind of hair is produced by fetal hair follicles during the 4-6 months of pregnancy. This is done by nature to keep the body warm in the womb and protect the baby’s fragile body.</p>\n<p>Generally, this hair shed during 32-36 weeks of pregnancy. In rare cases, babies are born with it. Being born with the hair doesn’t imply that there is something wrong with the baby. It is just as normal a phenomenon as a baby born with less hair. It is just unique in its way.</p>\n<p>With the youngsters born with lanugo, it is observed that the hair vanishes within a few weeks of being born. It is replaced by the finer less visible vellus hair which is very common among the other humans.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/dad-jokes-his-baby-born-with-a-beard-is-a-mini-wolverine/\">Dad Jokes His Baby Born With A Beard Is A ‘Mini Wolverine’</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>The name of the kid was Jonathan.

On the Q-Ship, Tony Stark was going to transfer his armor to Strange to protect him from Ebony Maw’s torture needles.” The amalgam of Doctor Strange/Iron Man was initially being supposed to be a part of Avengers: Infinity War. You guys can check out the cool art concept on Phil Saunders’s Instagram page.</p>\n<p>As mentioned Tony Stark would have transferred his suit to Doctor Strange after Thanos’ minions would have attacked them and kidnaped Doctor Strange. The suit would have protected Doctor Strange from Ebony Maw’s torture needles. But this art concept was dropped sue to various screenplay reasons while the production was ironing out the details of the Avengers: Infinity War.</p>\n<p>The armor for Doctor Strange is groovier as the Iron Man’s arc reactor in the middle of the suit is now replaced with Doctor Strange’s The Eye of Agamotto, which is known as the Time Stone by everyone. The armor has more of purple and silver for Doctor Strange than red and golden of Iron Man.

One of the reasons they did not get along with each other. Both of them were rich and top in their respective fields. They both have been similar archetypes. They both have a similar story of their origin in terms of wealth and work. Though Stark had a bit more than Strange but Strange was also well-off. Both were insanely gifted with success, looks, and arrogance.</p>\n<p>The similarities do not end here. Their stories and journeys were almost the same. Both faced unexpected tragedies and were physically impaired but saved at the end. Tony Stark by his gift of science and Doctor Strange by the gift of magic. After the tragedies, both came out as changed men with more knowledge and experience. Both valued the small important moments more.</p>\n<p>One more very important thing o consider is their pretty looks and facial hair when it comes to similarities.

He prefers to be more constructive instead of watching Netflix. Well, the project took a while, however, with more than eight hours of regular hard work, it got its existence. After all, it was pretty tough for him because the children’s contribution only added a little to the project.</p>\n<p>Besides, what came out to be the upshot was very eye-catching. His kids also love it to the T. They prefer to be around the hot spot instead of their beds. He admitted: &#8220;Me and the kids are sleeping in there every night at the moment and they absolutely love it! Even to the point where we pack up the car like we’re actually going camping, drive to the end of the road, turn round and come back and pretend that we’ve arrived at our destination.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Derry’s kids named the place as ‘the secret garden’ and made it their playing area. Even the process of making this project was a lovely journey for Derry. When he took his achievement online, everyone was as amazed as Derry’s family. He added that he had been incessantly receiving messages full of appreciation where people requested him to make one for them too. Also, many of them asked if they could visit the architecture he built.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the popularity proliferated so much that Derry decided to list his pod on Airbnb to quench his quest. To his surprise, more than 160 books and over a thousand messages inundated within a day. It&#8217;s so fascinating how a mere idea emerged to be so productive.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/dad-created-a-mini-love-island-in-the-back-garden/\">Dad Created A Mini Love Island In The Back Garden</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>The best part is you don’t have to step out, but think about some creative alterations in your home.

The storyline, though highly fabricated, does seem to come from a real place. Otherwise, why would anyone ever want to dig around for a sweaty and scary real-life Demogorgon? Though the monsters aren&#8217;t the main concern for mystery story enthusiasts, they are more intrigued by the less fictional parts of the series, which is now back with its third season.</p>\n<p>The story is set up in Hawkins, Indiana which doesn&#8217;t actually exist, but the Stranger Things actor Gaten Matarazzo confirmed to Wired this show is based on some true incidents. He further explains that the show is based on a place in Montauk, New York called Camp Hero. There are rumors of secret government spies doing human experiments to fight the Cold War.</p>\n<p>The series was also firstly named ‘Montauk’ after which it was changed to Stranger Things. Camp Hero is a former Military Base which has been notoriously rumored to be the field for kidnapping, mind control and time travel, under the not at all creepy moniker the ‘Montauk Project’. This topic has been a hot one for quite some time as a movie was also made on Camp Hero by the filmmaker Christopher Garetano, named the Montauk Chronicles.</p>\n<p>The storyline revolves around a group of men who were allegedly forced to be part of secret experiments that occurred in Montauk in the 1970s. The movie also included a local man Brian Minnick’s shared footage of underground chambers. Not only this, he also revealed that he had found evidence people were based way past the date of the official closure.</p>\n<p>The Army reportedly deactivated the base in 1947 and in 1951 it was transferred to the Air Force, who remained active at the site until 1982. The land was donated to the National Park Service in 1984 but the buildings used by the military still stand in Camp Hero State Park. One of the most famous structures is the Cold War-era SAGE radar tower, which acted as a mother station to a series of smaller radar towers working to warn officials in the event of an incoming Soviet nuclear attack.</p>\n<p>However, one theory linked to Camp Hero is that officials at the site used the radar tower in an attempt to alter people’s thoughts and control their moods by changing the frequency and pulse duration of the radar system. If this wasn&#8217;t enough the tower also mysteriously changed positions over a series of days in 2011, nearly 30 years since the Air Force is supposed to have left the site. The military tower also has underground tunnels which are thought to be the site for all the creepy stuff and is eerily similar to the maze in Stranger Things.</p>\n<p>While we may never know the truth about what really went on at Camp Hero, it’s safe to say the Duffer brothers have done a great job of spinning a story out of the conspiracy theories. And also, as said in Stranger Things, ‘Evil doesn&#8217;t end, it evolves’.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/stranger-things-is-inspired-from-a-controversial-military-base/\">Stranger Things Is Inspired From A Controversial Military Base</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Stranger Things has been the talk of the town for the longest time with its amazing star cast and storyline.

It has inspired many people to use sewing techniques to create some colorful PPE. As there can be other bright colors on the protective equipment, why shall we stick to the same shallow ones?</p>\n<p>Along with a small team, Adrian has prepared and distributed more than 600 suits as of now. Sewers can make about six to eight suits while working at home and four to five when they’re in the hospital. Adrian simply considers all the healthcare workers as modern-day heroes. “In general, all front liners and nurses, they are risking their lives and also their families’ lives as well,” he says.</p>\n<p>Materials used to design the suits must be fluid resistant. This includes microfiber, parachute with a silver lining and non-woven fiber that has been used to create the suits. Initially, the staff members at The Medical City Iloilo (TMCI) gave him a handout in making the suits for free.

She was first dean outshining her brothers with bow and arrow during childhood. Her wide-eyed love for weaponry became her means of survival, revenge, and means of protecting her own members of the family. During her long period of training, she is blinded and beaten and stabbed in the guts with the teaching of carrying the face of a dead.</p>\n<p>Although Arya&#8217;s victory didn&#8217;t settle well with all the viewers. Some of them even started accusing the showrunners of creating a &#8216;Mary Sue&#8217; character. For people who are unfamiliar with this term, the meaning is usually female, who is seen as too perfect and almost boring for lack of flaws, originally written as an idealized version of an author in fan fiction.</p>\n<p>Comparing Arya with Mary sue is in no way justified. Everything shown in the climax from her was so far built up for that moment. Many fans came forward with proper justification for that scene. All in favor of Arya&#8217;s victory mentioned all the training she had gone through to rightfully own that scene. Her training was widespread over 6 seasons and shown in detail. So the fans had an outrage on how can you miss that training period.</p>\n<p>People who were not in favor of the end got trolled by the fans who supported the story and many famous people tweeted in favor. Carolyne Larrington, tutor in Medieval English Literature at the University of Oxford said: &#8220;from the day we first saw her in Winterfell in S.1, ep.1 – taken her along a path that’s unconventional enough for a girl, but entirely fitting for a hero&#8221;. Even the Night king- played by actor VladimírFurdík said it was a good decision.</p>\n<p>Arya Stark was compared to her sibling Jon snow also known as king in the North and many more titles. People who criticized the end said Jon Snow or Daenerys Targaryen deserved the chance to kill the Night King. This is where fans said that Jon learned to ride a dragon in 5 mins where Arya risked her life living as an orphan. Maisie Williams who played Arya Stark also knew that everybody would hate it; that Arya doesn&#8217;t deserve it. Sadly, even the boyfriend of Williams appears to think Jon was the character more deserving of becoming the slayer of the Night King.</p>\n<p>No doubt Jon Snow worked hard to earn this level of respect and advanced skills of dragon-riding skills have been attributed to his Targaryen blood. But in the end, Arya&#8217;s victory is justified according to the storyline.

In no way, it means that the shows that we see in the present aren’t good, but there is definitely a unique appendage with Seinfeld.</p>\n<p>However, here’s the good news. A pair of developers from Melbourne are busy in creating a video game entirely based on the Seinfeld sitcom. Ivan Dixon and Jacob Janerka also uploaded a trailer (unofficial) for this 16-bit video game and they’ve named it as Seinfeld Adventure. They also tried to follow some of the aspects the same way as the original Seinfeld show. Every level would be 30 minutes long just like an episode of Seinfeld used to be.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1013\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1013\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1013\" src=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/New-Project-8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/New-Project-8.jpg 600w, https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/New-Project-8-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1013\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">YouTube</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Moreover, here the storyline will progress as to what you wish to happen. Just choose one character from George, Jerry, or Elaine. But you cannot pick Kramer because even the developers believe that Kramer is beyond someone’s control. Just peregrinate through the synopsis:</p>\n<p>Now, here is a publicist whom Jerry is dating. The obstruction comes in the way when she unintentionally reveals Jerry’s email address to Kenny Bania via group email. Jerry starts receiving many spam emails from Kenny in which he asks Jerry to submit feedback regarding his new stand-up set.<br />\nThe situation makes him so infuriated that he decides to break up with the publicist. However, there’s a problem with that too. Jerry seeks to avoid face-to-face interaction. So, Kramer recommends doing it by sending her an email and Jerry does the same.</p>\n<p>Now, Elaine arrives. As he tells, apparently, the publicist could help them all to get tickets to the opening night of the newly launched movie Rochelle, Rochelle 2. Before George could think of an idea to avert the publicist from reading the emails, Kramer apprises that he can get it done. Supposedly, he knew someone (Newman) who had always been a staunch supporter of analog mails. So, he might be having something in his mind to help them out of it.</p>\n<p>As the statement for the first level of this game has been released, it sounds very tantalizing. Besides, you’ll choose how the episode ends. The developers Ivan and Jacob have also obtained their animation work for shows like The Simpsons, Adventure Time, Rick and Morty, and several others. You can have a glimpse of their impressive works in Fallout, Wolfenstein, Game of Thrones, and The Watchmen.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, they are also waiting for the rights to be granted by the Seinfeld’s co-creator Larry David.

The device is connected to your laptop and blinks whenever someone posts about their break-up on the internet.</p>\n<p>The bulb looks ordinary at first, but when it is connected to the internet through a bridge, it gets notifications about the social media posts in which people have announced their break up.</p>\n<p>According to her website, she said that she hates Christmas and PDA from couples during the holiday season. So, she decided to make this light bulb to remind herself that she is not the only single person out there.</p>\n<p>According to her blog: “I really hate Christmas. It’s not a light joke like ‘Christmas or perish’, but I really don’t like it. I want to celebrate Christmas. But when you see a couple in the world going on a Christmas date and doing something like that, I am attacked by a huge sense of loneliness.”</p>\n<p>Adding further, she describes that she has a hobby of searching the words ‘parting’ or other related to it. Her hobby came after when she found an account created by some high school student, made for announcing things like anniversaries and other special occasions. And whenever a couple breaks up, they would announce by changing their icons to ‘Parted’. Inspired by this, Fujiwara created the light bulb which would blink whenever someone changes their status to parted or posted about something related to parting.</p>\n<p>According to the demonstration video, you can also adjust the color or brightness of the bulb using an IoT home appliance app.</p>\n<p>She explains: “This is a popular IoT home appliance that allows you to adjust the brightness and color of the light bulb from your smartphone. Also if you connect to other apps and turn on the electricity when you go home, the possibilities are endless. First of all, connect a bridge that will become a hub to connect the light bulb to the internet. Set up is completed by simply connecting to a WiFi router at home with a LAN cable.

The dead players are looted by the standing ones for their ammunition and health supplies.</p>\n<p>Usually in Warzone, a single enemy is dead within seconds if he or she comes in front of a squad. This event is commonly known as open fire. And we can see this might be true. Single-player in front of a team of four players does not stand a chance. Most teams do not think much and react soon. They kill their enemy and then loot it. It’s Warzone, we mean the game is meant to be played like that, violently!</p>\n<p>One such incident happened with one of the players named MensWashroom6-201U, a Reddit user. He was left alone as his teammates died in a battle and he was the lone survivor. MensWashroom only had a pistol left with him when he found himself surrounded by a team. The team soon realized that MensWashroom wasn’t firing in return and only had a pistol.They thought that he might have beenthe sole surviving member of his team.

The place was intruded by a third team who opened fire. The lone survivor then chose to help his new friends and provide them with a safe passage out. Thereafter, he started returning the fire with the pistol he was armed with. The lone survivor succeeded in providing his new friends a safe passage out but unfortunately did not survive himself. After all, all he had was a pistol and was against a squad.</p>\n<p>We cannot decide whether it was the right thing to do or not. After all, there is a saying “Everything is fair in love and war.” Sure, this is not war but just a game, a game about war. Killing the opponent is what you are supposed to do. Now it is your call whether you want to give your opponent a fair fight or kill them barehand. If our opinion shall be restricted to the game, then yes winning does matter.

A great achievement!! It was released on 10th March and didn’t take much time to attract the masses. On 14th March, it was also announced on the official account of Call of Duty that they’ve crossed the 15 million threshold already.</p>\n<p>Now, when you compare it with the previous record made by Apex Legends, Call of Duty relishes the victory by a huge margin. Within just 24 hours of the game’s release, six million players had already joined to play which is more than that of the existing record-holder Apex Legends as they had made it to 2.5 million players on the first day. Actually, it&#8217;s more than double.</p>\n<p>Call of Duty’s publisher Activision said in a press release:<br />\n&#8220;Warzone is more than a new era for Call of Duty, it&#8217;s a game-changer for players and fans.<br />\n&#8220;We&#8217;re delivering two incredible modes of play within this massive world that take the experience to a new level.&#8221; I hope we&#8217;ll get to see this number proliferating with the days ahead.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/call-of-dutys-warzone-location-resembles-real-life-chernobyl/\">Call of Duty’s Warzone Location Resembles Real Life Chernobyl</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Well, the same will add even more fun when you commemorate that a similar case happened in a video game.

Alex was struggling hard to find stuff that he could represent as a project for his students at the school. While questing for an intriguing element, his eyes landed on an old LPG cylinder.

Working hard on the theme, he ended up producing a wood burner donning the face of Darth Vader. Unbeknownst of the pending golden times, the teacher put it on display. Soon, the design managed to touch the corner of the world. It accumulated heaps of praise and applause for the budding wood burner designer.</p>\n<p>The light of fame of his design also reached the ‘Burned By Design’. They ended up roping the Yorkshire-resident in their work sphere. Four years hence from the professional break; Alex enjoys the privilege of being the company’s director and lead designer. To invest the best in his projects, he resigned from the post of the teacher. Thus, he stepped forward to embrace the alleys of burners as his professional sphere.</p>\n<p>As time ticked away, Alex kept on pouring out iconic designs and accommodated other characters of the animated series. People around the world lost their hearts to the iconic wood burners, fire pits and barbeques. The orders lined up madly to choke the supplies and making the waiting list extend to 32 weeks mark. His sister stepped in to share the burden by managing the customer-care service part.</p>\n<p>Taking on the product, Alex shared, “The time taken to make each design varies in the complexity of the design, some can be made in around eight hours, some take over a week and we try and price accordingly”.</p>\n<p>Burners have thus broken free from their age-old insipid sphere.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/former-teachers-project-spiraled-into-star-wars-wood-burner-business/\">Former Teacher’s Project Spiraled Into Star Wars Wood Burner Business</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Innovations feed on raging circumstances and sustain on the pearls of creativity.

This game has given the players a chance to fly anywhere on the planet they want.</p>\n<p>Though it is all virtual the looks are pretty promising and look very realistic. And now the aspects of the journey of all the players have exceeded in every way. Not everyone is indeed an airport person, people love holidays but not airports. Airports don’t top the list but when given a chance to explore all the airports on the earth no one would like to pass the opportunity.</p>\n<p>Till now 37,000 airports have already been manually edited by the studio for the game. The 80 busiest and iconic airports will be given extra attention to designing and editing. The 80 airports will be recreated with every precise detail and will be given extra properties to bring them into life in the game.</p>\n<p>The extra detailing will differ with each airport and all the things which are in real life at the airports will be included. From the unique vegetation outside the Heathrow station to the recreation of the hustle-and-bustle at John F Kennedy International Airport. The studio has even ensured to do the detailed designing of the signboards of the airports. From the surface definition to the designing everything will be done in great detail.</p>\n<p>Sven Mestas, the lead game designer shared: “In order to reach a new level of reality in flight simulation, we needed a new approach. That’s why we decided to innovate by editing airports from real satellite pictures. This technique involves editing each airport manually. This means that particular attention to detail has been given to every single one of them to bring them a step closer to reality.”</p>\n<p>Every airport has a different structure, terrain, and props. Thus, one will have great joy in exploring all the airports in detail. The game will be done and tested this year and will be launched at the end of the year which can be guessed by the name of the game. You guys just have to prepare yourself to embrace the chance of visiting every standing airport on the earth from your places.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2020-will-let-you-travel-every-airport-on-the-earth/\">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 Will let You Travel Every Airport On The Earth</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Asobo Studios has shared its new plans and development for the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, which includes the recreation of all the airports existing on the Earth.

And it is obvious to be so because there is a wave of overflowing anger against the barefaced treatment. Above all, as an esteemed organization, it becomes necessary to stand with what’s right. Or else, the repercussions would be waiting for you.</p>\n<p>As conspicuous, Valve has been facing the same issue due to its silence on the Black Lives Matter movement. Many indie developers have decided to remove their games from Stream. With several other companies showing their support to the movement, there’s an oddity when Valve remains silent. If at all, other organizations can contribute it in any manner, they are not hesitating from their step. However, Valve stands apart, with no voice being raised to support the ongoing movement. This silence has brought several questions to the gaming community.</p>\n<p>From the reports by Games Industry, game developers are now requesting Valve to remove their games from their platform. Julian Glander, the creator of Art Sqool and Lovely Weather We’re Having, has raised questions against Valve’s silence. He stated that Stream and Valve have decided not to address the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>\n<p>He added: “It’s clear than ever that the owners of this platform feel beholden to a base of angry white male gamers. This makes me especially sad because I feel that some of these people are the people who most need to hear the message of Black Lives Matter.” With this, he also admitted that he doesn’t want his company’s game to be associated with Stream as it seems embarrassing.</p>\n<p>With this decision, followed several supports to Glander from other companies as well. Other indie developers like Ghost Time Games also did the same. Gabriel Koenig removed Test Tube Titans from Stream, which followed by Dan Sanderson removing First Winter for the same reason. Besides, it wasn’t a typical decision for Koenig as he tweets: “I’ve been making ~$1000 a month in sales lately, and leaving that behind made me feel uncomfortable. But if I continued to profit from their store, I’d be complicit with their silence on hate.”</p>\n<p>For Sanderson, it was crucial to follow the principle. Even if it isn’t linked to earning money, going with the flow during this situation has become so important. For Valve, it’s still unclear if this step makes any impact so as to speak something on this concern.</p>\n<p>Well, this situation has given heat to a different debate. Some say that it won’t make any impact in the present scenario. Above all, we shall leave it on time to see what happens next. For sure, what some developers have done is purely a gesture to support the movement and stand against the one being silent for a while. They won’t have any intentions to oppose Valve, as of now.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/developers-removing-their-games-from-stream-due-to-silence-on-black-lives-matter/\">Developers Removing Their Games From Stream Due To Silence On Black Lives Matter</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>The arising stench due to the severe incident has reached several fields.

The researchers aimed to find it in other galaxies as well. Many researchers have invested enough time and energy to find the most abundant element of the universe.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, efforts are never go in vain. After so many researches, there is “the first detection of extragalactic molecular oxygen”. It was found far outside Milky way. A pleasant moment for all the scientists and astronomers out there.</p>\n<p>An astronomer of Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, Junzhi Wang pioneered discovery of molecular oxygen in Markarian 231. Markarian 231 is an eternal galaxy that is located around 581 million light-years from the Milky Way.</p>\n<p>Wang along with other scientists and astronomers were in the position to find ‘11–10 transition of molecular oxygen’ because of the modern technologies. Telescopes such as IRAM 30 m and the Northern Extended Millimeter Array Interferometer played a vital role in the discovery of molecular oxygen. These are a very high range of technology as discerning oxygen outside of earth is a really difficult task because of the earth’s dense atmosphere.</p>\n<p>As per a twitter handle 407 Dank, Markarian 231 is the nearest quasar to Earth. It is the bright, star-like point. It gains its light from the material swirling around a pair of supermassive black holes located at the center of the galaxy.</p>\n<p>Molecular oxygen was found twice in the past 20 years. The first time it was found in Rho Ophiuchi cloud which is 350 light-years from earth. It was found in Orion Nebula which is 1,344 light-years from the earth the next time.</p>\n<p>The redshifted light of Markarian 231 proved beneficial for the researchers. The color red has a longer wavelength which is why it traveled to our galaxy. Earth’s exasperating atmosphere was unable to block the oxygen emissions coming from Markarian 231.</p>\n<p>However, Markarian 231 is not a recent discovery. This quasar is nearest to the earth and was discovered in 1969 only. Swinburne University is of the view that they are active galactic nuclei and are the brightest objects in the universe. An assumption has been put forward by the scientists that it might be powered by black holes with the mass of more than one billion solar masses. NASA Webb will try to find how this black hole helps in the formation of stars and interstellar materials.</p>\n<p>However, no matter how great this discovery is, we are still not sure that if the life on our galaxy gets destroyed then we could reach Markarian 231 for survival as the vital mix of Nitrogen, Carbon dioxide, methane and other gases essential for our survival is still not found there. New astrochemical models are needed to explain the phenomenon on Markarian 231 which is several kiloparsecs away from the center of the galaxies.</p>\n<p>It is a big achievement for our scientists as compared to previous ones. The researchers are hoping that they will find something of more value soon.

This absurd lawsuit came out while playing an online video game is both serious and funny. The big question is you’re your constitutional freedom of speech extend to your right to speak over online multiplayer video games without being muted?</p>\n<p>According to reports of the Vice, Runescape streamer AmroElansari sued developer Jagex after Amro was permanently muted by Jagex. It is not a short game and the team had spent hours playing the game. And one could understand why he would get upset about losing his right to speech after playing the game for hours.</p>\n<p>Jagex with his other co-players spent hours playing the game. A game with a genre that requires player communication. But that is not all that happened, just because of a game with a genre of player communication that does not mean the players have to speak. Continuous and negative commentary while playing the game can bring down one’s morale down. Bas and unwanted communication hurt a player’s confidence and experience.</p>\n<p>If Jagex had felt that muting Elansari was the last option to win the game, he would have done the same thing. That is what is legally right as well. After filling multiple lawsuits through 2019, Elansari heard that the “First amendment freedom of speech rights doesn’t apply to private enterprises like this. And since the Runescape developers weren’t muting him based on protected characteristics like race or religion, his discrimination claims were similarly baseless. Not helping his case was a history of frivolous lawsuits like, say, being scammed on Tinder.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, voice chats over video games usually do not help the players. It gets annoying with time and brings down the morale of the players. With time it gets toxic not only for playing but for mental health as well. So if getting muted doe not go well with you even the courts cannot help you in this matter.

Found in 1996, Didymos is a pair of asteroids close the earth, and one of them, Didymoon, is the main target.

A possibility that some of the material may reach earth, can be used to study the asteroids close to the earth. Their composition can be studied by determining the color of the light they generate. For example, if there are blue meteors, then the asteroid is of magnesium composition whereas, if it is yellow then the makeup comprises iron.</p>\n<p>If the mission is successful, we may have the capability to defend ourselves from an apocalypse, the same which resulted in the extinction of dinosaurs, by diverging the rock away from the orbit of the earth.</p>\n<p>The impact can result in 22k to 220k pounds of centimeter-sized debris, a fair amount to say the least.

The graphics and other art elements have grabbed gamers’ hearts. Amused with its popularity, the game’s art director named Yoji Shinkawa went ahead to leverage the business position.

The lavish label holds a golden place for the fashion fanatics always scrounging for the style-inspiration.</p>\n<p>The immense love for the brand made Yoji Shinkawa look at the option of fusing the charm of two brands. He went ahead to foresee the windfall of gains that would rain with the tie-up hitting the business floors. The alluring business prospects made him shoot an invitation to Acronym’s co-founder &#8211; Errolson Hugh to discuss his business plan.</p>\n<p>Errolson got thrilled to find the invitation and walked in to illuminate their tie-up prospects. The two brands finally joined hands and came up with extravagant ‘Dead Stranding’ jackets.</p>\n<p>Shedding some light on the course of their tie-up, Errolson shared, “Turns out Hideo Kojima&#8217;s art director, the legendary Yoji Shinkawa, is a longtime Acronym fan and customer. Back in 2017 one of Yoji&#8217;s team reached out to us via email and this led to me visiting the new Kojima Productions studio the next time I went to Tokyo. This was a big deal for me as I have been a huge fan of their work ever since the original Metal Gear games on PS1 and PS2”.</p>\n<p>Adding to that, he said, “To find out they were fans of our work as well was kind of surreal to be honest”.</p>\n<p>After years of deliberations and efforts, the jackets finally hit the market.

The diehard lovers of the brand did not shy from adding the sumptuous stuff in their cart despite the high on the price tag. Acronym rushed out of the stock while putting up with the roaring demand of jacket even in the hot season.</p>\n<p>However, there was one thing missing in the package. In contrast to the promos, the product came in alone. There was no baby in the jar tugged on the apparel.

Although the corals may only amount to about 1% part of the planet, their eradication would affect marine life. Plus, they are also used for medicinal purposes as well as food. The decrease in coral occurs due to bleaching that takes place at higher temperatures. In this scenario, the algae come out of its tissue.</p>\n<p>Moreover, this reduction of corals in the Great Barrier reef has now left it like a shell of what it once was. And not only global warming, factors like pollution, over-fishing, and climate change are also instrumental in this case. Therefore, scientists worked on developing artificial reefs that could grow algae. Besides, they can stay riveted longer than the real ones as they are prone to environmental factors.</p>\n<p>The goal of the project is to restore the coral reef in copious quantities across the world. Even if the corals are artificial, scientists believe they’d work well in tempting fish and baby coral polyps that will get attached to the coral. This is where natural reefs would be helped to grow. For this project, Dr. Wangpraseurt worked with Professor Shaochen Chen, a professor with expertise in nano-engineering. Professor Chen is known to have developed a rapid 3D bioprinting method at the University of California.</p>\n<p>The replica produced was capable of functioning in the same way as the living tissues. Professor Chen said: Most of these cells will die if we were to use traditional extrusion-based or inkjet 3D printing processes because these methods take hours. It would be like keeping a fish out of the water; the cells that we work with won’t survive if kept too long out of their culture media.<br />\nOur process is high throughput and offers really fast printing speeds, so it’s compatible with human cells, animal cells, and even algae cells in this case.</p>\n<p>Scientists also developed cup-shaped, man-made skeletons made with a polymer gel PEGDA. PEGDA is relevant here due to its biocompatibility. To your surprise, the artificial corals have the ability to capture and scatter light more than a living coral can do. Besides, they also comprise a gelatin-based polymer hydrogel, GelMA which when combined with algae cells and cellulose nano-crystals can proliferate the photo-synthesis process in corals.</p>\n<p>Well, this step is so crucial to be taken at this point. As per the present estimation, a major part of the existing living corals in the Great Barrier Reef would disappear by the end of this decade.

The long wait for the action packed video game came to an end in June 2020. However, the release caused a chaos by dividing the electronic athletes into two squads. Naughty Dog, the developers of the game expected the division to be between the supporters and the haters. But, the division between the haters with a valid reason and haters without any justified reason came out of the blue for the developing team.</p>\n<p>The first and somewhat justified criticism came from the folks disliking the length, storytelling and some other bugs in the game. However, there were some people who had not even tried the game even a single time but gave it a rating of 0 out of 10 on the Metacritic website. The latter squad claimed that the story wasn’t how they wanted it to be and they felt as if the developers were promoting some agenda. They even slammed the directors for showing inappropriate romance.</p>\n<p>Neil Druckmann, the creative director of the game maintained his silence until he couldn’t keep his cool anymore. The self proclaimed gaming critiques were taking their troll game too far and thus the director went direct to address these haters. Neil went as a guest on the former Nintendo bossReggie Fils- Aime’s podcast and expressed his distress for such a rancorous criticism by the audience for fictional characters.</p>\n<p>The director said that he felt proud of their creation and had no intention to snatch the freedom of speech from their audience. In fact, he found some of the criticism to be healthy. But he couldn’t process a few bitter words that were being circulated against the characters that didn’t even exist in reality. He even spoke about the hatred being showered on the team members for playing a character that was a result of the developer’s imagination.</p>\n<p>Druckmann then further talked about the struggle his mind had to go through to process such a large wave of negativity that came in his life. He said that he initially tried to ignore the bitter comments as much as he could but he was blown to see things escalating so quickly. Not only that, but Neil also warned the critiques through the podcast that he would be reporting the matter to the authorities if the trolling did not stop.</p>\n<p>The actors and the developing team had been trying hard to focus on the positives in their life but the critics knew no limits. Sadly, even though some of us might understand the fact that varied people have variant opinions. But the difference between healthy criticism and trolling lies in the mannerisms of expressing one’s point of view.Therefore, throwing virtual filth at actors for portraying the character assigned to them cannot be justified.

The Lucasfilm was into waffle making business from quite past now from the Star Wars movies. Waffles make a perfect space snack since the members of the ghost Crew eats space waffles in Star Wars Rebels. Time and again Zeb can be seen having triangular-shaped waffles in space.</p>\n<p>Well, one can now have these waffles in their home while enjoying a Star Wars movie since they will be too easy to replicate. But there will be no space missions or ships around you for any war or battle. The waffle maker not only has different designs but also has an option of different temperatures. One can set different temperatures based on the child version you want to eat (if you can eat).</p>\n<p>The waffle makers can be used for much more than making waffles. They can be used as a panini press, cut sweet Hawaiian rolls in half and toast them or cook eggs in it. The waffle maker is available at a pre-order of $39.99 and will be shipped in September 2020.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/baby-yoda-is-now-in-waffle-making-business/\">Baby Yoda Is Now In Waffle Making Business</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Baby Yoda from Star Wars has an unforeseen future which surely predicts a bright and rocking future with an unstoppable force.

Thus, the wizarding world tales did not dry up for the girl.</p>\n<p>The parents told her that she was a witch and wizarding world was real. Not just that, they went further by telling her that their family drew a bloodline from the wizarding world. Growing up with the false notion, the seven-year-old girl flaunts herself believed to be a witch. The parents thought their move to be right. According to them, it gave her the motivation to reach her full potential.</p>\n<p>Not just that, they backed their stance by dragging in the view of her teachers. They said that the teachers believed it was awesome and creative rather than damaging.</p>\n<p>The post jolting the Twitter world said, “She is almost eight and as her questions have gotten deeper, we&#8217;ve kept building the illusion with more details about our family genealogy and its connection to book characters, stories about times we used magic (and the life and moral lessons we learned about it)”.</p>\n<p>Adding to that, it said, “Before other parents judge or lecture; we know it&#8217;s gaslighting and eventually she&#8217;ll be disappointed and have trust issues with us when she learns the truth.

Adding to the glory of the celebrated moon excursions, NASA is back on the screens with its plans for Moon Mission 2024.</p>\n<p>NASA’s Artemis mission has become the talk of the space town. The space agency has rocked the sphere with its Moon Mission 2024 plans fueling the curiosity around the world. What’s illuminating the charts is the moonwalk that the astronauts will undertake after landing on the lunar surface. It is 16 times the one that the first men to take on the moon took back in 1969. The moon heroes walked at a speed of 1.4 miles during their moon exploration. According to experts, at that speed, the distance of 10 miles can be covered in seven hours approximately.</p>\n<p>However, the heavier suits could have acted as a drag on the speed of astronauts at that time. To ebb the besets of the astronauts in 2024 mission, the agency has come up with Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU), which draws inspiration from the ones that International Space Station and Apollo Space Mission astronauts don. The protection from chilling surroundings is also one of the considerations the designers have to deal with. The absence of gravity there adds to the difficulties of the astronauts to go for a walk around.</p>\n<p>Adding to the moonwalk, NASA is also looking forward to explore the icy and cold side of the lunar body. The traces of water are also shimmering on its bucket list. Surprisingly, NASA has not undertaken any moon mission, landing its astronauts on the surface after the 1972 Apollo 17 mission. It has consistently worked on upgrading its astronomic system keeping in mind the progress raging around the world.</p>\n<p>Taking on the activities going on at the agency, NASA EVA systems engineer Natalie Mary shared, “This is where we’re going to test out technologies, utilise lessons learned from EMU and obviously Apollo, in order to get to 2024. We do have some things that we are holding off [on] for sustained lunar [exploration]”.</p>\n<p>Thus, there are right hopes for the space fanatics to see the dawn of the new truths in space science. Not just that, other formidable space players are also enduring hard to make their mark on the silver space gem. Adding to the winds of amusement are the new facets of the other planetary bodies that are coming before the space scientists. For instance, the famous dwarf planet- Pluto is fueling the idea of an ocean lacing its surface that originated some 4.5billion years ago.</p>\n<p>Hence, there seems no end to the space tales and theories that keep on boosting the space souls.

The survey aimed to estimate the time and money spent on online gaming. Also, to understand the habits of gamers. The habits might not be surprising but the money and time spent in the online gaming world might leave one surprised. Though initially, the investment is not that bad.</p>\n<p>According to the survey, gamers spend three years of their adult life playing online games. Which is equal to nearly five percentages of their average adult lifespan. It was also revealed that they spend more than $20,000 on the games in that period of their time. The players spend money every year in installments in areas such as renewing their membership, buying new accessories which amount to $20,000 over some time.</p>\n<p>Every year money is spent on new accessories, downloads, and microtransactions. This amount is just of the online games, but if we talk about the factored-in consoles and single-player releases the amount invested might be higher.</p>\n<p>Managing director for ISP at Hyperoptic, Charles Davies said “It&#8217;s clear from the research just how passionate and dedicated gamers are to their hobby, reflected by the time and money spent on it. Online gaming is a popular way of staying connected to others and conversing while playing at the same time.”</p>\n<p>The players told that they spend around eight to nine hours a week playing games online. And since the start of the lockdown which started due to the global pandemic, COVID-19 the time spent playing online games has increased. The time has reached closer to ten to eleven hours in a week. Well, at least they are keeping themselves busy and not going out. Going out unnecessarily will just increase the spread of the global pandemic.</p>\n<p>Meeting up their mates in Verdansk and take a trip to the Gulag is safer and more exciting than meeting everyone in person and taking a trip to London. The gamers also revealed that a classic gaming session lasts around for 2 hours. The gamers usually meet up virtually from their homes at 6 pm and the gaming session continues till 10 pm. Till then people can join and leave. Whatever time in between suits them.</p>\n<p>This sample of 1000 gamers included a mixture of gamers. That is ranging from beginners to pro-level gamers. As the level of gamers increases the time and the money spent on online gaming also increases. The pro players might end up playing 20 hours or more. And the real games begin after 10 pm for them.</p>\n<p>And when it comes to games and challenges there is no end to games and challenging the fellow players for one more round of the game. Stay safe and healthy until everything settles down. While playing online might be keeping players busy but health is also important.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/study-reveals-the-time-and-money-spent-playing-games-online/\">Study Reveals The Time And Money Spent Playing Games Online</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Internet service provider Hyperoptic recently conducted a survey of 1000 in the United Kingdom.

The house has recently been renovated so that it can be put up for sale. The house is surrounded by greenery and is at a beautiful location and up for grabs for $1,900,000. But the location and the beauty of the house is not the only thing that makes it interesting.</p>\n<p>In 2001, a couple lived there and one of them died in the house. Kathleen Peterson died in that house. Died is not the right word, the right word is murdered. Kathleen Peterson was murdered in the house by her husband. Her husband Michael Peterson was put on trial and then was jailed for the murder. Though initially, he did not confess about his crimes, he made the whole thing look like an accident. He claimed that his second wife had fallen down the stairs and died due to the intensity of the injuries.</p>\n<p>But after proper investigation, the authorities found that he bludgeoned his wife to death and made the whole thing look like an accident so that he could cover his crime. But the authorities were able to get down to the bottom of the truth. Her husband who is a novelist was convicted in 2003 but was freed in 2017 after he submitted a plea. He submitted an Alford plea.</p>\n<p>An Alford plea is a plea, whereby he acknowledged prosecutors had enough evidence to convict him without admitting guilt. The house was being used for the Staircase and was further used in The Handmaid’s Tale. Now the property is up for sale and the listing states “Historic 3.5 acre, 9,500 sqft home in Forest Hills, Durham. Home has been recently renovated. Wrought iron gates, Swimming Pool, Brick &amp; Stonewall Walkways. 5 bedrooms, 6 bathrooms, 19 total rooms. Grand Staircase, Library, Game room, Kitchen Island, Master bedroom wing and guest family wing.”</p>\n<p>It further reads “Brick Patio with fireplace, Slate Patio, Lower and Upper Gallery. 2 separate gated entrances to the home. This home has been featured in Netflix documentary as well as a major feature film.&#8221; The film The Staircase shows the whole murder with great details. The couple’s adoptive daughter supported Peterson through the whole trial.</p>\n<p>It was Kathleen’s sisters who were dead sure that their brother-in-law had murdered their sister.

Viewers have been quick enough to pour out their reviews and poise the performance of the shows. Thus, it is not a few and far moments to find the acts lingering amidst the torrent of criticism. One of them making a mark in that domain is the show- Summer Heights High.</p>\n<p>The character- Jonah Takalua is the heart of the show. The celebrated actor- Chris Lilley donned the privilege of playing that character that revolves around a Tongan schoolboy. The show made its mark in 2007 on ABC. Jonah was quick to garner a warming response from the viewers. But the clouds of disgust soon began to build up over the character. The flag bearers of the motion are not happy with the portrayal of the character. They have found it biased and igniting stereotypes against the community.</p>\n<p>One of them is Filipe Mahe. The man shot into limelight with his act in the documentary series- Our Boys in 2004. The series revolved and tried to bring into light toil of students and teachers with the ‘&#8217;cash-strapped government school&#8217; at Canterbury Boys High in Sydney. He represented ‘charismatic and cheeky Tongan schoolboy having a tough time because of his reading, writing and family difficulties’.</p>\n<p>According to Mahe, Jonah has drawn inspiration from his character in ‘Our Boys’. He mentioned that Chris had paid a visit to his school after ‘Our Boys’ to play a role. After watching the ‘Summer Heights High’, Mahe realized that it was his part. He is not happy with the portrayal of the character.</p>\n<p>Taking on that, he shared, “I knew from that episode Jonah was me. I&#8217;ve always thought it was racism to Tongans but never spoke out. I would have been labelled a &#8216;sook&#8217; or &#8216;can&#8217;t handle the banter&#8217; so I didn&#8217;t say anything”.</p>\n<p>Shedding light on reason of disgust, he shared, “Young Tongan boys have been stereotyped as dumb, clowns, a nuisance.” He further added, “I feel like I&#8217;m responsible for this stereotype and that hurts the most. It hurts that people think I spoke in that manner to the public or to my family. I&#8217;m upset that people think I&#8217;m dumb or uneducated. I&#8217;m upset at how people think of me”.</p>\n<p>Well, Mahe is not alone in flagging concerns clinging to the character. The head English teacher from the Canterbury School, who was also a part of Our Boys in 2004, has also joined the chorus. The teacher- Daryl Currie does not like the use of brown shade for Chris to resemble Tongan boys. He sees it as an insult to the community. According to him, the character is not the true representation of the group. It also cements biases against them.</p>\n<p>The ‘Black Lives Matter’ movement has powered up the motion against the character. Thus, Netflix has removed four Chris shows- Angry Boys, Summer Heights High, We Can Be Heroes and Jonah from Tonga in response to the raging worldwide criticism against racism.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/man-says-he-was-the-inspiration-for-jonah-takalua-but-the-character-hurt-him/\">Man Says He Was The Inspiration For Jonah Takalua But The Character Hurt Him</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>With entertainment banking on the bounties of technology, series and shows have begun to traverse across national frontiers to woo souls across the globe.

It revolves around two main characters Ellie and Joel. The game is all about Ellie taking revenge which makes it interesting as well as vicious.</p>\n<p>It is a game developed by Naughty Dog. A lot of people miss on being onboard with its progress. It demands a lot from the gamers. From head tilts to knee jerks to going through a lot mentally. This game actually causes the adrenalin rush in anyone who gets into it. A famous streamer, Crank is a recent example of it. The game really got on his nerves. A particular scene affected him mentally.</p>\n<p>A particular part of the game involves Joel being brutally beaten up to death with a golf club. For the ones who have been an avid part of the game regarded the scene to be unacceptable. Although the scene was important to take the game forward, it infused anger and emotions in a lot of gamers. Making changes in a character around which the whole game moves around was really disturbing for the gamers. Many streamers lost control after witnessing it.</p>\n<p>While many streamers did not stream their reaction to this scene, Crank was very open about it. This scene disturbed him so much that he destroyed his disk in anguish. The very death of an important character of one of his favorite games was not acceptable for him. A lot of his followers and fans believe that his action was based on his experiences in real life. The death of Joel in the game reminded him of his father’s death. He was very close to his father who died battling cancer.</p>\n<p>The real story is still unknown as to what lead him to take this step. If the death of his father was the cause of his actions then we can imagine how painful it would have been for him to go through that scene. It was really disheartening to hear this.

Their content and act go miles ahead to create the waves of charm and grace. The lights of fame nurture their golden marks in the pages of history. One of these exemplary acts is Joker. The 2019 film buried down all the records of its predecessors for a fresh start in the world of blockbusters.</p>\n<p>Joker drove the viewers crazy with its power-packed content. The audacious portrayal of the ‘Clown Prince of Crime’ by Joaquin Phoenix stole the show around the world. It became the first R-rated movie to take on the $1 million mark across the globe. Its proud director Todd Phillips bathed in glee to kiss the tokens of achievement and fame. The movie draws its roots from the flunked life of a comedian named Arthur Fleck. The sense of failure loomed larger to take on his mental health, forcing him to unleash the wave of violence in Gotham city.</p>\n<p>However, the movie is not all about the shining stars. The big hit thrived with the blots of extreme violence that led the censor boards across the world to fix its rating for adult viewing. The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) set the age rating to 15 for this film. Despite that, the premieres and shows witnessed a huge rush of viewers longing to catch the powerful act.</p>\n<p>But the other side of the story has emerged from the covers. According to reports, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) has received complaints totaling to 149 for the year 2019. The number is quite less than that featured for 2018 films. Out of 149, 20 are against Joker for its age rating- 15. It has made the film as the U.K.’s most complained about film of 2019.</p>\n<p>The viewers did not feel it right for the viewership of souls aged 15. The nerve-wreaking violence in the film takes things too high for the budding souls. They thought that BBFC should have set the age floor at 18 for the film.</p>\n<p>However, BBFC has another view of the matter. They have defended their move to fix the floor at 15.</p>\n<p>Taking on the matter, they said, “Several stated that we should have classified the film 18 because of violence and the film’s tone. A small number felt that the film should be banned. There are scenes of strong violence in the film that include stabbings and shootings, with accompanying bloody injury detail. They do not, however, dwell on the infliction of pain or injury in a manner that requires an 18”.</p>\n<p>Apart from Joker, the other films to feature on that dark ground were ‘The Favourite’ and ‘John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum’.</p>\n<p>The former knitted the brows with its extensive use of sensitive language and excessive pressing on seductive scenes. Other won the opprobrium for its reliance on violence to weave the storyline before the viewers.</p>\n<p>Thus, not all big hits spawn their eulogy and glory.

Fans bubble around to walk through the background of the characters to catch-up with the emotions and acts floating around. Grabbing the urge, Marvel thus often tosses in the background narratives. But the decisions are not always free from the stereotypes lurking on the Marvel board. The Canadian actor named Peter Shinkoda threw light over the issue.</p>\n<p>Peter shot to fame with his iconic characters in ‘The Predator’, ‘I’, ‘Robot’ and ‘Godzilla’. Donning his mettle, the actor worked good lines for his character ‘Nobu Yoshioka’ in the Marvel series- Daredevil. The series began to weave the acme of fame in 2015 and finally halted his charm in 2018.</p>\n<p>Nobu was on the side of the villain of the series- Madame Gao that Wai Ching Ho played. He was part of Madame Gao’s deadly group- The Hand. The actor appeared on the scene many a time to add to the evil intentions of the dreadful Madame Gao. He illuminated the show by appearing in nine episodes of the series between 2015 and 2016.</p>\n<p>The actor opened up the unknown facets of Marvel board when he joined the other artists from the show at the “#SaveDaredevil” discussion. The character had supported the villain. But their relationship and background never came on the counter. Taking on that, he shared that there did come storylines for the characters. But the then Marvel Television Head named Jeph Loeb struck the proposals down. According to the head, nobody cared about Asian characters. He had gone ahead to cite the debacle of Marvel’s ‘Blade Trilogy’ to support his stance.</p>\n<p>Giving in to the beliefs of Loeb, the writers had to write off his character’s narrative.</p>\n<p>Thus, the link between the two evils never came off the covers.

But they were a part of the series then.</p>\n<p>Taking on the issue, the actor shared, “I’m kind of reluctant to say this, but… I’m going to take this moment.

But a recent initiative dared to land in the pool to find his best film by giving his fans the space to vote for their Ferrell favorites.</p>\n<p>It is not odd to find fans ending up in a war of words trying their best to make their favorite Will’s movie stand till the end. Grabbing the madness and love for Will Ferrell’s movies, a contest put them face to face to win the title of being the best.</p>\n<p>It invited his fans to show the power of love for their favorites by voting for them. There were three rounds in total to test the strength of his acts. After moments of thrill and anxiety, the results came fluttering in the air. They were astounding enough to shake Will’s fan base.</p>\n<p>His ‘Step Brothers’ emerged as the winner in the fray. The 2008 hit thumped Elf, The Other Guys and Anchorman in the decider. The winner reached the top spot by garnering 44% votes in its favor. Others had to satiate their fans with 27%, 21% and 6% of the total votes respectively. The votes in all the three rounds mounted to the score of 45000.</p>\n<p>‘Elf’ is a Christmas film. ‘The Other Guys’ revolves around a newsreader. On the other hand, ‘Anchorman’ is a cop comedy.</p>\n<p>‘Step Brothers’ stands out in the context of its contents. It reflects on the forging of a bond between two stepbrothers whom the fate united. Its description reads, “Brennan Huff (Ferrell) and Dale Doback (John C. Reilly) are immature adults still living at home. Brennan lives with his divorced mother, Nancy, and Dale lives with his widowed father, Robert. Robert and Nancy meet, fall in love, and get married, forcing Brennan and Dale to live with each other as step brothers”. Thus, it is more of a family affair that bubbles in the encumbered world quelling the flowers of love and understanding.</p>\n<p>The decision is no doubt not free of pending opprobrium as the love for Will’s hits run high among his fans.</p>\n<p>But they can soothe their nerves by relishing the news floating around. Things are building up to clear the way for a sequel of ‘Will’s Wedding Crashers’. He gave out the hints when he was promoting his new Netflix show- ‘Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga’ with Rachel McAdams. Rachel was also his ‘Wedding Crashers’ co-star.</p>\n<p>Taking on the sequel of Wedding Crasher, he shared, “Wedding Crashers 2, yeah. I think we can just say it&#8217;s being written.

For instance, in a FIFA game, the fans are enabled to resume playing with their teams’ growth after turning the consolation off, simultaneously the other gamers can take a flight right from the point where they left and make sure that the point from where the game is left is worth understanding.</p>\n<p>Moving further, it was found that the thought of erasing all the data of their game accidently is intolerable to the gamers. Also, apart from their home destroyed, one out of ten gamers would rather have their car crashed or their wedding ring lost than losing their game data, while one in five responses recorded that they would prefer misplacing their phone over losing their game progress.</p>\n<p>All the data was proved right when one of the respondents, Dinara, opened up about her experience from back in 2015, when she was at the verge of having a heartache because she almost lost her game progress. Elaborating her suffering she commented that she was eagerly waiting for the release of Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate and wanted to be amongst the first people to play it. She burnt her midnight oil playing and scoring in the game. She was almost through with the game when the tragedy took place.

This deleted all her game’s progress and to this date she is unable to pick up the advancement in the game and complete it.</p>\n<p>This truly reveals that 90% of a gamer’s brain is devoted to their actions in game than towards their bosses in real life businesses. Coming to the frame, David Darling CBE, CEO of Kwalee stated that he is happy being part of a company which makes ‘quick, fun mobile games’ which stops the gamers from worrying about this damage.

However, it is doing more than that. Like, it is breaking facial recognition algorithms as well. This is a completely unintentional role played by face masks.</p>\n<p>Nothing ever comes with perfection. There are already 5% error chances associated with facial recognition algorithms in a normal situation. The error rates have jumped to 50% with a face mask on as it covers most parts of the face like nose, mouth, and chin. This was found in a study by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</p>\n<p>There is more addition to the problem. The new 50% error rates depend on the color of face masks as well. Black colored masks are likely to catch up with the algorithms when compared to blue masks.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, blue masks (surgical masks) protect you in a better way from the virus. On the other hand, it breaks the facial recognition algorithms. This in turn makes it more difficult to use this algorithm to unlock phones in a public place.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, it is established that the more part of the nose is covered with the mask, the more problematic it is for the programme to recognize a face. This makes it more difficult to use this unlock pattern in public places whilst protecting ourselves from the deadly virus.</p>\n<p>As per Mei Ngan, as the pandemic came in the picture, the need for a detailed study of facial recognition algorithms has increased. There has developed the need for the study which will show how face masks are manipulating facial recognition technology.</p>\n<p>Mei confirmed that they had been studying the algorithm before the pandemic began. But now as the subjects are wearing masks, the study might get disturbed. However, they are planning to have a study later in the summer which will study the veracity of algorithms that will be focused on masked faces.</p>\n<p>The common study of NIST includes studying the distance between different facial features. Thereafter, different facial recognition algorithms are tried, tested, and verified. But with face-covering few facial features, the fidelity of the algorithms is reduced. However, there still are a few devices available that are functioning just fine. Lucky are those people who are not facing any issue with facial recognition algorithms. They are free from all the hassle in the public place.</p>\n<p>iPhone is known for its security and protection of privacy. That is why its facial recognition algorithms are different from every other programme.

However this time the American comedian Joe Rogan gave his version of criticism in a conversation with Joe De Sena on a podcast. Many parents worry about their kids getting addicted to the games which often consist of content that they find objectionable. And whether you like it or not Joe Rogan is on our parent’s side.</p>\n<p>The digital gaming industry is reaching new heights of success ever since the corona pandemic came into existence. Many youngsters have opened their channels about the tutorials of various games. The 52-year-old comedian had some strong choice of words against this E-gaming trend. He called this new platform a waste of time and a serious concern for the society. Addressing De Sena on the topic, Rogan said that the kids these days need to do something more challenging like physical sports.</p>\n<p>The comedian believes that the youngsters need to set some offline goals for themselves and come out of the virtual world for their good. Rogan said that these games are the real problem because of the fact that they are fun and exciting which makes the kids spend more and more time. He said that the youth spends so much of time on the virtual fun that they overlook all the opportunities of having some real fun. Rogan further said that digital gaming doesn’t take people anywhere and makes them stagnant.</p>\n<p>The comedian even compared digital gaming with martial arts which, according to him is the real sport. Rogan explained that a person who is into martial arts has a lot of potential of growth and maybe opening their own sports school. And that is not the case with the video games, as per the comedian. The 52-year-old also showed his concern about the deteriorated physical health conditions that the digital gamers can have, due to inactivity.</p>\n<p>Rogan did acknowledge the flourishing E-gaming industry but he also threw some light on its pitfalls. He agreed to the fact that kids are making a lot of money via digital gaming but it won’t be long lived if they do not adapt to the upcoming games as well.</p>\n<p>It’s not at all surprising to see the youngsters thinking otherwise and coming up with some logical reasoning. Some of the kids trolled the comedian whereas; the others argued that digital gaming helped them connect with their pals in the stressful lockdown conditions. The gamers believe that gaming is not as simple as the people think. And it requires a lot of skills and dedication to be an E-gamer. Some people also compared the digital gaming with book reading. They claim that just like reading is soothing for the readers, gaming is soothing for the gamers.</p>\n<p>Seems like the comedian’s rant opened a new debate window with people coming up with new ways to defend their beloved platform- E-gaming!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/joe-rogan-says-videos-games-are-a-waste-of-time/\">Joe Rogan Says Videos Games Are A ‘Waste Of Time’</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Video games have always been at the receiving end of a lot of criticism, with the leaders of this anti-gaming squad being our parents.

Whether it is ranting on social media or spending hours over videogames, we find our happiness in the virtual world. For our generation, Sony is the brand that is associated with the dream gaming gear that every gamer, whether amateur or professional dreams of having. Yes, you guessed it right. We are talking about the play station.</p>\n<p>Sony till date has launched four versions of this little box of happiness. The last version of the play station- the PS-4 was launched seven long years ago and the electronic athletes have been keeping an eye out for the next version. The company declared their intentions of launching a PS-5 with a number of new and exciting features along with many color variations to suit your interest.</p>\n<p>The British company, Truly Exquisite that is known for the modification and customization of the gadgets has come up with some really shimmery plans. However, their products are directed only towards the people willing to splurge on something which many of us would consider useless. The company has kept a proposal for making a 24k gold-plated PS-5! And of course, it would be a limited-edition collectible.</p>\n<p>The UK based customizing company is offering many different modifications of the soon to be launched PS-5. To make things more fancy they are bringing forward three different versions of the same gadget. The 24k and the 18k rose gold-plated versions along with the platinum version if you are trying to save a few bucks. And if you feel like the richest man of the planet, you can also book a custom matching headset and gamepads for yourself.</p>\n<p>The company hasn’t confirmed the official release date. But the brand may play Santa and launch the gadget in December to lighten up Christmas. There have been no details yet about how much the customized play station would cost. But it’s for sure to make your pockets feel a lot lighter. Looking at the previous records of the company who has launched gold-plated apple items too in the past, the cost of the golden PS-5 could be anything between hundreds or thousands of pounds.</p>\n<p>The rose gold and the platinum versions may come at a slightly lower price, but would still be expensive than the usual. So you may want to double up the speed of your savings. Some new features expected to be in the PS-5, whether you go for the fancy gold or the normal one, are the fast gaming speed.</p>\n<p>The PS-5 would load the games at a speed 100 times more than the PS-4. The SSD drive is set to pack 825GB which would give a speed of running at 5.5 GB per second in the raw mode and 8-9 GB per second in the compressed mode. If you are already excited about its launch, you may want to book one for yourself right now since the company would make just 100 gold versions.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/truly-exquisite-all-geared-up-for-launching-their-golden-play-station/\">Truly Exquisite All Geared-Up For Launching Their Golden Play Station</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>We are a generation that lives online.

Contributing to the widening spectrum, the researchers at the University of Delaware have illuminated the world.</p>\n<p>The researchers have made the breath-taking claim of having found the material that can go a long way in uniting AI with the complex human brains without pushing ahead the drastic repercussions. They have called the magical substance Pedot. They made the ground-breaking revelation at the American Chemical Society Fall 2020 (virtual expo) on 17th August.</p>\n<p>According to the researchers, the material could navigate the signals between the electronic devices, brain and muscles without damaging the tissues.</p>\n<p>The researchers were initially working with rigid microelectrodes for the purpose. But the plan did not yield the desired result as the brain is organic. Thus, they then started to look around for the material that could facilitate the link between AI and human brains. They checked out for the ‘organic electronic materials’ like ‘conjugated polymers’.</p>\n<p>Finally, they came across the antistatic coating for electronic displays. Then, they went ahead to work on the potentials of Pedot.</p>\n<p>Taking on the marvelous discovery, Dr David Martin, who led the research, said, “We got the idea for this project because we were trying to interface rigid organic microelectrodes with the brain, but brains are made out of organic, salty, live materials. It wasn&#8217;t working well, so we thought there must be a better way. We started looking at organic electronic materials like conjugated polymers that were being used in non-biological devices”.</p>\n<p>Adding to that, he said, “We found a chemically stable example that was sold commercially as an antistatic coating for electronic displays”.</p>\n<p>As per the researchers, the material and successful use can open the way to treat many nervous disorders and conditions. Not just that, when put up with dopamine, the substance can go a long way in dealing with the problem of addiction around the world.</p>\n<p>Well, they are not alone in the fray. There are also some big names putting in their might to grab the links and facets of the subject. One of them is the millionaire- Elon Musk. He has spilled out the bits of relief for the ones tussling with the monsters of depression and substance addiction. He has blown off the covers for a neurological device catering to the purpose. However, he has not unveiled its details, bits of working and extent of efficacy on the ground.</p>\n<p>The star has named it Neuralink- a computer chip (a product of Neuralink Corporation of Musk started in 2016).</p>\n<p>Answering the query of a Twitter user, Musk said, “For sure.

Other Avengers&#8217; cast like Mark Ruffalo (Bruce Banner), Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye), and also Brie Larson (Captain Marvel) had an interaction with Bridger, and they described him as &#8216;courageous,&#8217; &#8216;heroic&#8217; and &#8216;thoughtful.&#8217;</p>\n<p>The brave boy has got 90 stitches in the unfortunate incident.

Talking about his work, he has informed the upcoming 12-issue limited series &#8220;BRZRKR,&#8221; which will be launched on October 7.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a comic book series for Boom! Studios, which was planned after Reeves met them the previous year to create an autobiography, in which the main character is none other than Keanu. He told USA Today the whole story about the planning, revealing that he finds some time to interact on Skype for &#8220;BRZRKR&#8221;, while being in Berlin for the rehearsals of &#8220;Matrix 4.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As of now, we are just aware that the story will definitely be filled with several twists. As for the character, Reeves had portrayed his idea about the character &#8220;who was born 80,000 years ago, half-man, his father&#8217;s a war god. It&#8217;s a little fantasy in reality.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He added: &#8220;I had this image in my head of a guy fighting through the ages because of his father&#8217;s compulsion to violence,&#8221; but with the pathos of a man &#8220;trapped and trying to figure it out.&#8221; The story, co-written with Matt Kindt, the man named Berzerker is a half-mortal and half-god, an entirely different context from the one we see in usual movies.</p>\n<p>Also, the seemingly immortal character would be seen working for the US government, doing jobs in return to get bits of the reason behind his existence. Moreover, the team behind the work involves the illustrator Alessandro Vitti, color artist Bill Crabtree, letterer Clem Robins, and conceptual/cover artist Rafael Grampá.</p>\n<p>And here is the synopsis for BRZRKR:<br />\n&#8220;After wandering the world for centuries, Berzerker may have finally found a refuge – working for the US government to fight the battles too violent and too dangerous for anyone else. In exchange, Berzerker will be granted the one thing he desires – the truth about his endless blood-soaked existence… and how to end it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The editor-in-chief, Matt Gagnon, also finds it gladdening to work with Reeves. He admits that you can quickly assimilate why Keanu has gained this huge success, just by talking to him for a while. Meanwhile, Kindt also supports this statement, saying Keanu has added his touch of creativity to obtain a story that isn&#8217;t just the run-of-the-mill.</p>\n<p>Keanu has also asked Kindt to add his imagination to the story. Besides, the story will not only revolve around the events filled with blood and guns; you&#8217;ll witness a &#8220;warm guy&#8221; but &#8220;world-weary&#8221; because of his days of yore. More precisely, you&#8217;ll come across a character with an astounding memory and being fluent in several languages.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/about-the-comic-book-brzrkr-written-by-keanu-reeves/\">About The Comic Book, &#8220;BRZRKR&#8221; Written By Keanu Reeves</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>We have already seen his work in movies like John Wick, The Matrix, Bill and Ted, etc. Now, for sure, his fans cannot wait to see another flabbergasting side of their favorite actor.

The film got released in 1977 and had stunning visual effects and the musical notes used to communicate with the UFOs were a genius stroke from John Williams. The film is much more than a naive wonder and whimsy at the prospect of visitors from another planet.</p>\n<h3>#2 E.T.

The basic plot is just like any other alien movie: E.T. is left behind on Earth and ends up befriending a 10-year old kid, ensuing in shenanigans. Still, E.T. is, in many ways, much different from other films with a similar conceit as Spielberg focused more on childhood and emotional bonds.</p>\n<h3>#3 Alien, 1979</h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1288\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1288\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1288\" src=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/alien.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/alien.jpg 600w, https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/alien-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1288\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Imgur</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Alien was directed by sci-fi pioneer Ridley Scott and struggled to get funding in its initial phase of conception until Star Wars showed up to turn the tables. Set in classic sci-fi inspired claustrophobic atmosphere, it is a story of a commercial spaceship that encounters a deadly Alien that leaves a death-trail and destruction in its wake. The brilliance lied in the terrifying way used to build suspense and never show the full horror.</p>\n<h3>#4 The Terminator, 1984</h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1289\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1289\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1289\" src=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/New-Project-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/New-Project-4.jpg 600w, https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/New-Project-4-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1289\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Imgur</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The year is 1984 and a cyborg assassin sent from 2029 to kill a woman whose son could be the savior of humanity in the post apocalyptic future!

He released its second part in 1989 followed by the final instalment of the trilogy in 1990 with a western spin on a tried-and-tested formula.</p>\n<h3>#6 Jurassic Park, 1993</h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1312\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1312\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1312\" src=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jurrasic.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jurrasic.jpg 600w, https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jurrasic-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1312\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Imgur</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Directed by Steven Spielberg, Jurassic Park was, for the audience, a venture into the extinct. With amazing visual effects and extreme detail, Spielberg almost convinced us that such a thing as bringing back the extinct was quite possible. The plot of the story is set in the world where people go to Jurassic Park for amusement where they keep all kinds of dinosaurs and, as expected, one day the hell breaks loose.</p>\n<h3>#7 Contact, 1997</h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1291\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1291\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1291\" src=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/contact.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/contact.jpg 600w, https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/contact-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1291\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Imgur</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The genius of Carl Sagan drools out of his novel Contact, which later got adapted to be a film, but with the same title.

Eventually, a repeating system appears from Vega Star System, and she enters an international race to decipher the code, to be chosen to respond to the message.</p>\n<h3>#8 Men In Black, 1997</h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1293\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1293\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1293\" src=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/men-in-black.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/men-in-black.jpg 600w, https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/men-in-black-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1293\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Imgur</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This comic-based and fun-filled film questioned the contemporary ideology of serious sci-fi cinema. The story follows a secret organization that goes by the name ‘Men In Black’ where they are tasked with supervising aliens on Earth and make sure they get into no trouble and they use “neurolyzers” to erase human memory. This film turned into a franchise with a lot of spin-offs, but couldn’t beat the original one.</p>\n<h3>#9 The Truman Show, 1998</h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1294\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1294\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1294\" src=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/New-Project-1-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/New-Project-1-2.jpg 600w, https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/New-Project-1-2-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1294\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Imgur</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Today, The Truman Show, released in 1998 might not seem like a sci-fi movie. It discussed the anxieties related with mass surveillance. In today’s world, we might have become a little more welcoming to the never-blinking electronic eyes, this movie follows Jim Carrey as he realizes that his life was a reality TV show and every incident was scripted. This film had a huge cultural impact and even inspired the name of a psychological condition.</p>\n<h3>#10 The Matrix, 1999</h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1300\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1300\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1300\" src=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/matrix.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/matrix.jpg 600w, https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/matrix-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1300\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Imgur</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The movie that established Keanu Reaves was an ultimate fusion of modern science and philosophy of existence and perception.

The hero of the movie builds a team of people who understand the dreamworld and uses technology to infiltrate into powerful people’s dreams. Hans Zimmer’s music and DiCaprio’s performance is a mind-bending story is an amazing cinematic piece.</p>\n<h3>#13 Source Code, 2011</h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1304\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1304\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1304\" src=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/source-code.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/source-code.jpg 600w, https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/source-code-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1304\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Imgur</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Director Duncan Jones’s Source code was his another critically acclaimed hit after his debut in Moon.

The smart speakers listen to you patiently whenever you call it. But most of you don’t know that the same smart speakers listen to your private conversations.</p>\n<p>A team of researchers at Northeastern University and Imperial College London took the initiative to determine whether the smart speakers of different companies record private conversations from the surroundings. The companies included Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Google. For their study, the researchers used Netflix by playing different shows in different accents and voices for 134 hours. The team also recorded the whole thing by setting up cameras. The cameras were able to capture the speakers lighting up which depicts the listening mode.</p>\n<p>The study was shocking and according to the study, all the shows woke up the smart speakers at least once. The shows triggered multiple devices to wake up at different times. And on average the speaker remained activated for five hours listening to the audios in the environment. But to sum it up the experiment conducted resulted in one mis-activation per hour.</p>\n<p>The smart speakers were mis-activated more when the accent of the shows was not English. This determines that households using smart speakers where English is the second language experience more ears dropping by the speakers. There is a higher breach of privacy in such households. People speaking at distance also triggers the smart speakers to get activated. There are cases when the smart speakers are mistaken with the words. They interpret them as their wake words and get triggered. But there were instances as well from which the smart speakers didn’t make the same mistake twice.</p>\n<p>David Choffnes, Ph.D., study co-author and an associate professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University shared that “People are always asking ‘Are the devices constantly recording?&#8217; And we have no evidence to support that. When the devices do wake up, they don’t record for minutes or hours. It tends to be on the order of single-digit or tens of seconds.”</p>\n<p>But now the main question is what should be done? A former manager at Amazon Web Services, Robert Fredrick shared that one can change the settings of the smart speakers. Robert shared that while having a private conversation he usually turns of the smart speaker. One can even monitor the recording. In Apple devices, one can go to the recordings and delete whatever they want to. Recordings are recorded to make improvements in the product but privacy is also important.

Just like our parents, President Donald Trump too, held video games accountable for promoting mass shootings. He blamed the games for glorifying violence and presenting the criminals as heroes.</p>\n<p>A group of researchers, led by Aaron Drummond from New Zealand’s Massey University, performed a study using the method called meta-analysis on the available data from the previous studies. The idea was to confirm whether the accusations put on video games were true or not. The data that they collected belonged to 28 studies done individually by different research groups back in 2008. They performed their calculations on the bundled data which revealed only a minuscule positive correlation between gaming and aggression.</p>\n<p>This study report was published in the journal Royal Society Open Science and clearly stated that it could not provide any evidence to take the parent’s side. And this wasn’t the only study conducted on the topic. Some of the studies showed a small positive correlation whereas, some even suggested that video gaming reduces aggression. And we guess we don’t need to tell you which one is the gamers’ favorite.</p>\n<p>Some people still stood rock solid with their accusations and claimed that every single round of gaming leaves the player a bit more aggressive which one day blows off. However, the study did not support this argument at all. Another study as cited by Futurity tried to explain that the hostile behavior of the players is not due to the video game’s content but because of the frustration caused by a failure in the game.</p>\n<p>Drummond and his team even studied the long term effects of gaming and still didn’t find any logical reasoning behind the video games being guilty of causing violence. The researchers in a statement invited more researchers and psychological professionals to contribute to what they had found.</p>\n<p>And even though, this body of researchers has put in their heart and soul into the study to bring out the alleged fact in the best way possible, yet some still object to it. But anyhow, their efforts have for sure won the gamers’ heart.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/study-declares-zero-correlation-between-video-games-and-violent-behavior/\">Study Declares Zero Correlation Between Video Games And Violent Behavior</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Not all heroes wear capes to woo you with their insane stunts.

The villa can accommodate 20 adults and 10 children at once without anyone fighting over rooms.</p>\n<p>The rooms are allotted just like the students of Hogwarts were allotted their houses. According to the website of the Loma Homes, a Sorting Hat is located in the main hallway, guests are invited one by one and they are allotted different houses. If one is Gryffindor at heart, you will get a room finished with brick walls and a bed that looks like the front of the Hogwarts Express which is Harry’s room. The best part of the room is that the smokestack smokes and whistles. The surprises do not end here. If one has to look closely they can find Harry’s luggage sitting in the room with his trusty owl, Hedwig.</p>\n<p>Different rooms are inspired by different incidents from the series. One room is inspired by a scene in “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.” The scene is at the start of the second year of Hogwarts when Harry and Ron Weasley crash Mr. Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia into the Whomping Willow tree. The bedroom has a car-shaped bed and on the wall, the Willow tree is painted depicting as if the car is hitting the Willow tree.</p>\n<p>Many adults might find them in the shoes of a teacher and Professor Dumbledore’s office will be the appropriate choice for them. Fawkes the phoenix will keep a watchful eye over you while you sleep peacefully and the staircases flanking the bed can be used as the drawers to keep your clothes. If you are a Slytherin at heart, then be prepared for a green room looking like a dungeon with snakes all over it as your bedroom. The room is decorated with snake motifs and glowing orbs.</p>\n<p>A true Harry Potter-themed rental vacation home is incomplete without the cupboard under the stairs. The cupboard under the stairs is built just like the one Harry slept in at the Dursleys’ place. One might not actually sleep in it but surely can sit and read there. It is the best spot for some quiet reading.</p>\n<p>From the bedrooms to the hallways to the staircase everything is based on Harry Potter. The staircase is decorated with beautiful portraits but thanks to the lords that they don’t speak and even the staircase does not move. There is a replica of Dumbledore’s chair in the dining area that features a long wooden table, a chandelier with electric candles.

The popular log flume ride opened in 1989 at Disneyland and in 1992 at Walt Disney World. On June 24th, Disney announced that the Splash Mountain would be transformed into The Princess and The Frog. Disney themed parks will be getting a major thematic overhaul. The Disney fans will be going down the bayou instead of plunging into the briar patch because the Splash Mountain will be transformed into The Princess and The Frog.</p>\n<p>The Splash Mountain has thousands of fans because of its adventurous and thrilling five-story drop but with that, there is brewing controversy with its characters and storyline. The storyline and the characters are based on a film from 1964 named ‘Song of the South’. Disney Executive Chairman, Bob Iger called the film racist and felt that it was not appropriate for today’s world. The racist film was not released and was kept from the eyes of the public. The film did not even make it to Disney’s streaming service, Disney+.</p>\n<p>Though the Walt Disney Imaginers were working on the project since last year with the recent events the attraction to the project has increased. Disney was working on the project titled “New Adventures with Princess Tiana” and has put in a lot of hard work in it. The announcement was made at a significant time with the wake of the protests following the killing of George Floyd. The ‘Black Lives Matter’ was one of those protests that had everyone in it together against the administration that does not treat everyone equally.</p>\n<p>It had great significance and impact on social media. The transformations and re-theming that are planned for the Disney themed parks will be happening both at Disneyland and Walt Disney World. News is Tokyo’s Disneyland’s version is also in for consideration for the upgrade. According to The Disney Parks Blogs, the themed parks will pick up from the last scene of the movie. The transformations will be the next part of the final kiss. It follows Princess Tiana and her alligator friend Louis after the kiss as they are ready to attend their first-ever Mardi Gras concert.</p>\n<p>In an interview with D23, Bob Weis, the official Disney fan club, Walt Disney Imagineering President, explained why Imagineers chose “The Princess and the Frog” and its heroine, Princess Tiana, as the inspiration for the new ride. “Tiana is a modern, courageous, and empowered woman who pursues her dreams while never losing sight of what’s important.” He continued “So it’s a great story with a strong lead character, set against the backdrop of New Orleans and the Louisiana bayou.”</p>\n<p>The fans will get the last chance to ride The Splash Mountain before all the transformations will begin.

However, her ex-boyfriend was on a different page here and that led some insane ideas in his head.</p>\n<p>This Australian woman started receiving some weird calls with people on the other end making Chewbacca noise. It baffled her at first but she soon realized who plotted this revenge.</p>\n<p>Jessica’s ex-boyfriend posted flyers around Cairns in northern Queensland with her phone number written on them. He encouraged the people by offering $100 (£55) for the &#8216;best&#8217; Chewbacca impersonation. It seems like he is a huge fan of the Star Wars movies.</p>\n<p>Chewbacca, a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise was Han Solo&#8217;s co-pilot known for that sound it makes that’s quite pronounced. So, this ex-boyfriend decided to make Jessica hear some of the impressions of that distinct voice through his “genius” revenge plan.</p>\n<p>After people came across those posters, Jessica’s voicemail was flooded with messages sounding a lot like Wookiee roars. Her phone rang continuously for two weeks and she heard those strange noises during the day and night. We guess that reward mentioned along with the furry creature’s picture motivated these people to a great extent!</p>\n<p>Jessica said, “This has got to be the most childish break-up I&#8217;ve ever had. All he had to do was say ‘I don&#8217;t love you anymore, I wanna move on.’”</p>\n<p>This became a source of amusement for her after a while and wanted to be mature about this situation. “I&#8217;m getting phone calls at really strange hours of the night about one o&#8217;clock to about four o&#8217;clock, eh. I thought it was quite funny actually, I thought it was a good joke,” she revealed.</p>\n<p>As this continued, she felt that she needed to take the matters in her own hands and end this “contest” for once and all. “Someone called and said they thought it might have been done as a joke because they watched (a man) put up the poster. It hurts my feelings,” she shared. This prank had gone way too far now.</p>\n<p>Her ex-boyfriend even went ahead and blocked her driveway by parking his car after removing its tires. That annoyed her and finally, called the police. “The police got in contact with me and finally they&#8217;re going to do something about it.”</p>\n<p>Jessica revealed the reason for their break-up and stated that it happened when she stumbled upon his Facebook messages and saw a few that he had sent to other women. “I thought when we first met he was mature, but it just goes to show having a job doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re mature,” she shared.</p>\n<p>The prank snatched quite a few peaceful days from Jessica and she is just hoping for this to end. This mum is also poking fun at those participants at the same time. “If there&#8217;s anyone out there that can do the real Chewbacca sound, I might marry you,” she told during an interview.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/man-plots-revenge-against-ex-girlfriend-starts-chewbacca-roar-contest-by-posting-her-phone-number/\">Man Plots Revenge Against Ex-Girlfriend, Starts ‘Chewbacca Roar Contest’ By Posting Her Phone Number</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>When one person in the relationship starts acting up, the partners would definitely notice the change.

It is a headless robot that can unfold and fold itself from the back of an autonomous car. One just has to assign it with the deliveries that need to be dropped off.</p>\n<p>CTO of Agility Robotics, Jonathan Hurst said, “Our goal with Digit is to have a robot as a mobility platform that can be inhuman spaces, go where people go, and work with people. And there are so many applications where that’s going to be a useful and important task. One of the big ones is package delivery.”</p>\n<p>He further shared “A robot vehicle that can drive on all our roads is going to be able to do that. But how do you get it from the vehicle to the doorstep? And that’s where our robot comes in. That’s what Digit can do.” Ford shared how he can navigate through stairs and get around unexpected obstacles while carrying a maximum of 40lbs of weight. According to Ford, Digit has LiDAR sensors and several stereo cameras fitted in it which helps it to navigate. The same technology that is used on self-driving cars.</p>\n<p>Jim McBride, Ford’s senior technical leader in robotics, explained the whole process of navigation and deliveries in detail. He said: “We’d envision the autonomous vehicle to arrive at the site with all the information you’d need to know about starting a mission. We’d have the prior maps and the vehicle would be able to aid the robot when it got out of the vehicle, in knowing where it was and where it needs to go.”</p>\n<p>He further said, “And additionally, the autonomous vehicle is full of sensors and computers that can help the robot, which is a little bit thriftier around those components. Should it run into any difficulties in package delivery, we can either solve the problem on the car or we can relay that information to the cloud for further assistance.”</p>\n<p>The autonomous car, the technologies used in assisting, and navigating is all too fascinating. The autonomous car will be there with Digit to help it in assisting and navigating if any problem arises. Ford and Agility Robotics have their hands deep down in the new contactless delivery system. But there is no word when they will launch it in the world. Once Digit is unleashed in the real world the industry of home delivery will never be the same again.

Taking into consideration the current data densities, the lecturer has estimated the growth rate of digital bits at 50%. Keeping the growth to that mark in the future times, he has ended up projecting the content of digital bits to rise to half of Earth’s mass by 2245.</p>\n<p>Not just that, the data bits would also surpass the growth of atoms on the planet. At 50%, the digital bits will equal the number of atoms on Earth in 150 years.</p>\n<p>The upkeep of the data business would suck the power production on the planet. According to the study, after 130 years, the power required to support the data issues would equal the power production of current times.</p>\n<p>Also, he has promulgated that there would be 1 kg of digital bits on the planet stored around the planet on all kinds of data storage facilities.</p>\n<p>Dr. MelSvin has brought out the baleful “information catastrophe” lurking around into the limelight. Not just that, he has also gone ahead to widen the platter of crisis like climate change, environment, population, food, health, energy and security, by including it.</p>\n<p>Shedding light on the points of study, he shared, “Assuming the current growth trends in digital content continue, the world will reach a singularity point in terms of the maximum digital information possibly created and the power needs to sustain it, called the information catastrophe”.</p>\n<p>Taking on the approaching power disaster, he said, “At the same time, the digital information production alone will consume most of the planetary power capacity”.</p>\n<p>Throwing up the significant figures and estimates about the results of the study, he said, “In the extreme case scenario when our digital information production growth is sustained at 50% per year, by the year 2070, we will have 1 kg of digital bits content on the planet stored on all the traditional and cloud data storage centers and endpoints such as PCs, smart-phones, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices”.</p>\n<p>Adding to that, he shared, “Similarly, at 50% growth per year, by the year 2245, half of the planet’s mass will be made up of digital bits”.</p>\n<p>Thus, the senior lecturer has pulled the curtains up to present the whirls of crisis thriving around the world. Not just that, a global data war in future times is also not a remote possibility.</p>\n<p>There is a lot of brewing to rankle up the souls neglecting the caveat bells chiming around.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, think tanks would grab the estimates and projections in spirits.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/earth-will-not-be-able-to-sustain-its-digital-data-in-200-years/\">Earth Will Not Be Able To Sustain Its Digital Data In 200 Years</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Data clouds are blooming with every passing second to accord to the ever-increasing demands of the consumers around the world.

A woman, however, saw her part crumbling down after her engagement.</p>\n<p>The woman saw her dream day evolving in the mist after getting engaged to her love in December. The couple then began to frame their love prospects. They decided to work hard together to put enough for their wedding day. Seeing his confidence and resolve, she vested her faith and money in the plans. After some excruciating days, they ended up saving $8000 for their big day. Everything was going in line until one day.</p>\n<p>Her fiancé saw a gaming PC at his friend’s place. Since then, the urge to have one in his possession began to loom larger over his mind. He began to crave for it. The man started pressing her to give the permit to buy one. At first, she asked him to enjoy his playtime on his laptop. But after his consistent requests, she permitted him to go for one.</p>\n<p>She saw a set consisting of the PC, a gaming chair, table, a keyboard, mouse, headphones and a microphone set (all wireless) landing at their paradise. Stunned to see the package, she asked him about its cost.</p>\n<p>She felt the land beneath her feet shifting when he told her that he had spent their entire savings on it.</p>\n<p>She chided him for his approach. But to her dismay, the worst was yet to turn up. The man got glued to the PC. He began to ignore her and his work. He would only see her face when he would call her to serve him food and water.</p>\n<p>The woman began to see the loneliness enveloping her life. She also began to see herself as his waitress, living there to meet up his survival needs. Giving up on the circumstances, she decided to turn to Reddit’s platform to drive some inspiration and advice.</p>\n<p>Sharing her agonistic life, she said, “It has been about two weeks since he got the PC and since then, my fiancé hasn&#8217;t gotten up from his new chair. Ever since he got the PC, he hasn&#8217;t even seen my face. The only time he talks to me is when he is hungry, he calls to me and tells me to get him something to eat/drink. I call him to watch TV and he denies it saying that he&#8217;s busy. I call him to sleep together and he denies it and says that he&#8217;ll sleep later”.</p>\n<p>Adding to that, she shared, “I honestly feel like his waitress now a days because from the past two weeks, the only interaction we both have is him asking for food and water and me giving it to him”.</p>\n<p>Some social media users attributed it to gaming addiction, while others presented his foul intentions.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, love will blossom again for them.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/guy-spent-6400-of-wedding-and-honeymoon-savings-on-a-gaming-pc/\">Guy Spent £6,400 Of Wedding And Honeymoon Savings On A Gaming PC</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Wedding day is a matter of efforts and financial penance that the couple put together.

And now, there’ll be a new campground where you can enter the world of Princess Mononoke. The place is being created to make the exact, realistic campsite as we saw in the movie. The designing part is in the process and is in the hands of a Danish design company, Nordisk.</p>\n<p>Prior to the designing process are the ongoing planning and developmental phase. We can expect to see this new world in 2021. Besides, the campground also emphasizes the idea of “nature as a park.” It will be a beautiful place to visit, for anime fans. The construction has already commenced in the month of July. Moreover, the main motto here is not just to stick with the idea of creating a theme park in a natural abode, Hygge Circles Ugake is also focusing on the Japanese model to devise several Sustainable Development Goals, taking tourism and entertainment in consideration.</p>\n<p>The attraction will be located in Expo 2005 Aichi Commemorative Park in Nagakute City near Nagoya. Also, there will be five separate areas to visit: Hill of Youth, Ghibli’s Large Warehouse, Mononoke’s Village, Valley of Witches, and Dondoko Forest. All we can do is wait till the end of 2022. While the Hygge Circles Ugakei will open its doors soon in 2021, it still feels like some years away.</p>\n<p>And if that’s the case with you, there are several other places to have a bit fun for the time being. How about visiting the Studio Ghibli museum? Just take a tour of the Inokashira Park in Mitaka, Japan, and ease off the waiting time until the next year.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/princess-mononokes-world-is-set-to-open-its-doors-in-2021/\">Princess Mononoke’s World Is Set To Open Its Doors In 2021</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Along with Princess Mononoke, other movies like Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, Howl’s Moving Castle, etc. are also worth watching.

I learned to do the splits just for this photo. Deadpool has honestly made me way more confident. Anyone who has read or watched anything about Deadpool, knows his face and body are pretty messed up. So it’s only natural that I cosplay him. I wanted to be authentic as possible, and that was to not wear a mask. It’s so easy to cover up who I am, and to give In to despair. Deadpool just makes me not care about that stuff and show my true self. This is me, and I’m not Ashamed about it. Deadpool is icy clean, and he’s helped my self esteem so much. I’m owning who I am, and cosplaying Deadpool makes it that much easier.</a></p>\n<p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jadiant/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Ｊｏｈｎｎｙ <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f525.png\" alt=\"🔥\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a> (@jadiant) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-01-24T20:22:15+00:00\">Jan 24, 2020 at 12:22pm PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script></p>\n<p>We all at some point in our lives must have hesitated to talk about our insecurities but Jadiant has never had any qualms in talking about how he got burned.

Imbibing and emulating their heroic deeds in the real-life, an anonymous man is strolling through the Santiago alleys to illuminate the might of humanity against the mongering monster of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>The city of Santiago (Chile) is seeing the superhero tales springing out of the books and comics to festoon the dingy nook and corners of the city supporting poor. The credit of this vibrant transformation goes to a man. The noble soul is rendering his selfless service of humanity to society with his skin breathing under the guise. He does not wish to pull the spotlights on him while delivering the social good around the city.</p>\n<p>To make his pious intentions work around, he takes to the streets, donning the much-celebrated grabs and look of Batman. He drives out to look for the homeless people shivering on the streets with empty stomachs. On grabbing the nerve-wracking sight of the people in need, he pulls over and hands out plates of simmering food from the boot of his car to them. Gradually, the aroma of his humane act wafts around, alluring the seekers of humanity to salvage their lives wedged between the teeth of the pandemic.</p>\n<p>After a few moments, one can see a beeline of hungry souls waiting to grab hold of their plates behind his car. Not just that, his charismatic looks adds to their joy. They keep their beset hovering in the minds at bay for a few moments and cherish their meal moment with their superhero. Well, Batman appears on time and regularly to keep up his commitments to make this world a better place to live.</p>\n<p>His free food distribution initiative goes a long way in soothing the severe economic and health circumstances around the country. The country is witnessing a burst in the number of unemployed souls sitting around. The unemployment rate has touched the ceiling of 12%, the worst ever in the country’s past economic decade. As a result, several people have lost their jobs, living and accommodation to the raging pandemic blues. The scenario slips down further, nearing the gloomy end, in the suburbs and rural areas. They are going through the roughest patch to withstand the heat of pandemic.</p>\n<p>Taking on the appalling conditions, he shared, “Look around you, see if you can dedicate a little time, a little food, a little shelter, a word sometimes of encouragement to those who need it”.</p>\n<p>He keeps his Batman look on while delivering the plates owing to his good intentions. The superhero in the pandemic aims to unite people toiling in the whirlwinds of agonies. Not just that, he also looks forward to taking people to happy times by harnessing the fantasy bits for them.</p>\n<p>To his delight, his aims have seen the light and woo hearts around.

Alan Weinstein a physicist, at Caltech mentioned that these readings were the highest ever observed.</p>\n<p>These black holes are so densely packed that not even light passes through them. After their recent encounter with the biggest bang, they found out how two normal size holes transfused and made one giant black hole. These holes were categorized as per their sizes. The small ones were called stellar, they were formed when a star is collapsed. As per scientists, they were black holes that were sized million times the size of our sun.</p>\n<p>Astronomers were so confused when they received the signal. They assumed that if a star that grew that big, it would have consumed itself. The blast shouldn&#8217;t have left any trace.</p>\n<p>Nelson Christensen, research director of the French National Centre for Scientific Research, mentioned that star collapses do not create that big of stellar black holes. Mostly they are 70 times the mass of our sun. This information became a contradiction when two detectors caught signals originating from stellar black holes. The signal depicted that one of the black holes was 65 times and another being 85 times the mass of our sun.</p>\n<p>The final result was calculated and it came out to be a black hole with 142 times the mass of the sun was formed. Due to the collision, a gigantic amount of energy was released in the form of a gravitational wave. This wave rippled out at the speed of light. These were the waves that were detected by the physicists using LIGO and Virgo detectors around last year. After getting the reading from the signal, they did their research and later published it in Physical Review Letters and Astrophysical Journal Letters.</p>\n<p>The detectors that were used allowed them to catch gravitational waves in audio form. So, the signal that was caught was about one-tenth of a second. It was the sound of a thud. Physicists also mentioned that this collision happened around 7 billion years ago. They only caught it now because it happened very far distance.</p>\n<p>Scientists were so confused because of previous encounters with the black holes. They were small before the merging and even if they fused, they didn&#8217;t pass the size of a stellar black hole.</p>\n<p>Avi Loeb from Harvard said that it might work as Legos. It would work like joining small pieces to make bigger objects. After Weinstein and Christensen considered this they thought it made sense. Adding to this Janna Levin, Barnard College astronomer, said how there is a slight chance that from the start both the black holes were created differently. The Holes might have been capturing smaller holes as they passed by.</p>\n<p>Even after so many theories, scientists could point a pin in how the merged black holes were floating around space and had grown bigger. The massive black holes might have existed since the Big Bang. Further, Weinstein added that how they are surprised by every new thing they find out in astrophysics.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/black-holes-merged-into-a-bigger-bang-than-the-big-bang/\">Black Holes Merged Into A Bigger Bang Than The Big Bang</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>The signal was of the biggest bang since the Big Bang.

Known as ‘Techmaster’ on social media, Phomvongsa has built the costume with a drop-down iron mask and a brilliant light on the chest that denotes the ARC reactor of Iron Man. With 195,000 followers on TikTok, Techmaster has received an enormous 2.5 million likes with this expressive work of his.</p>\n<p>The costume designed by him has some imposing features that can even draw the attention of the non-Marvel fans. These features include rockets shooting off the shoulders, flames coming out of the hands and a built-in-electronic sledgehammer. As exciting as it sounds, this extraordinary replica might have been costing Brandon a fortune. He, therefore, has arranged a GoFundMe page for people to donate him some money so that he can keep working towards bettering this suit.</p>\n<p>In the explanation of this online fundraiser, Phomvongsa told people how he has devoted the past 8 years of his life to this costume. He further added how he has made numerous changes in this suit in all these years as he gained more knowledge and understanding. He wants to add so much more to this costume for which he wants people to help him with the funds. He had made YouTube channels in the past but they didn’t really work for him. Hence, he decided to keep recording his work along the years and has almost recorded every moment of him working on the suit.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CEfhfBPJ860/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

But after a short interaction with the director Derrick Borte, he was convinced with the story and was ready to work for it.</p>\n<p>Besides, the conversation focused not only on the glory of the recent ones but also on those we saw in the previous decade. Crowe also commemorated the success of ‘The Nice Guy’ on Amazon. Then the entire talk centered on ‘Gladiator’ commemorating its beauty on its 20th anniversary. Crowe couldn’t make his mind on considering a sequel for Gladiator.</p>\n<p>Even for the lead actor, it was the best among all he has witnessed. He had never been so ebullient than he was for this astounding movie. Twenty years have passed by, and there are still considerations to further take the story, but we cannot Maximus to be alive, who has already died. On the contrary, there are still many who are not convinced of putting steps for the sequel. The simple reason is that it has grabbed an Academy-award, which makes it a part of history.</p>\n<p>Crowe believes that the process of film-making is enervating and challenging as well. You can see everything going south even if you had put up your impetus to make a good movie with a high budget, several good actors, and also a good script. With his further attempt to explain the beauty of Gladiator, he also shed light on the flabbergasting performance of Joaquin Phoenix, calling him ‘one of the best bad guys in cinema.’</p>\n<p>The performances by Richard Harris, Oliver Reed, David Hemmings, DjimonHounsou, and Connie Nielsen were another strong pillar to make the movie an exquisite piece of history.</p>\n<p>He added: “The seriousness of the actors as they would come into that world and what they wanted to discover, and the questions they’d ask the director.

It can be simple that would just lift off those big burdens you have been carrying around. Once they are off, you’ll feel light, confident, and relaxed.</p>\n<p>According to the research, having an alter ego can serve as a ‘self-distancing’ tool and that is crucial in certain cases. We all need to refrain from impulsive actions during a complex situation and this is the way to control those sudden emotions to burst out.</p>\n<p>We can gain the power of self-control once we adopt the alter ego. You won’t be fidgeting with nervousness or pacing up and down your room while stressing over any little matter.</p>\n<p>Rachel White, assistant professor of psychology at Hamilton College in New York State reassured us by revealing, “Self-distancing gives us a little bit of extra space to think rationally about the situation.”</p>\n<p>The research involved a few studies to understand the impact of having an alter ego. One of those studies involved some people who were ready to give a public talk. These participants were told to keep their thoughts in the third person to build a bridge between themselves and their emotions.</p>\n<p>The results revealed that the ones who successfully ran their thoughts in the third person conquered their anxiety and felt less stressed.</p>\n<p>The next study involved a few 6-year-old kids who were given the task of pressing the space bar whenever they encountered an image of cheese among other pictures running across the computer screen in front of them.</p>\n<p>The research team encouraged those kids by telling them they are a part of a ‘very important activity’. Also, that they would be ‘good helpers’ if they sit through it for a longer time. Initially, the team gathered the kids in one room with an iPad with many games installed in it to distract them from the main task.</p>\n<p>Before beginning the task, the researchers told these children to think about their feelings if they are bored mid-way.</p>\n<p>The first group was told to think in the first person – ‘Am I working hard?’ The next group was convinced to keep their thoughts in the third person &#8211; ‘Is Hannah working hard?’</p>\n<p>Finally, the last group was encouraged to step into the character of their favorite superhero. They were even given the outfit and accessories to adopt the role completely. They would ask themselves, ‘Is Batman working hard?’ when stuck in a monotonous cycle during the task.</p>\n<p>The results proved everything! The children who thought in the third person spent 10% more time on the task as compared to the ones who thought in the first person. While adopting an alter ego of a fictional character led to those kids spending 23% more time on that activity.</p>\n<p>Rachel White kept these results in mind while concluding that adopting an alter ego can lead to good self-control, emotional stability, and less stress.</p>\n<p>It’s time you decide an alter ego that suits you the best!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/adopt-an-alter-ego-like-batman-to-feel-less-anxious-and-gain-self-control/\">Adopt An Alter Ego Like Batman To Feel Less Anxious And Gain Self-Control</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>When we think of alter ego, we are immediately reminded of Batman.

They unleash the reign of terror and destructions to rip apart the grounded lives. Souls have to toil hard to pull their lives back on the track and rebuild their happy spheres. Also, these times test the relationships and bonds between people. A couple saw that sphere of calamity when their house got in spate in China.</p>\n<p>Floods have become a new normal for the Chinese people around for this year. They have devoured settlements and cities across the country since June. Some have cited the floods as the worst in the last two decades.</p>\n<p>As a result, 744,000 people across 26 provinces have lost their homes. 63.46 million people in the country are toiling hard to resurrect their world. Out of these agony-stricken souls, a couple has made waves around with their love and devotion.</p>\n<p>The Chinese couple, like other residents, saw the water levels rising around and enveloping their home in Yudong, Chongqing, China. But they could still see the hope that the roaring water would spare the second floor of their house. To their dismay, their lines of hope began to shatter with the water levels continuously rising around. They started recollecting the things dear to them in their minds but still in the house.</p>\n<p>Then, they realized that the husband’s favorite toys and action figures were lying inside. The pernicious water levels threatened them not to take any unpragmatic approach to save them. But they were in no mood to let them go under the water. Thus, the wife decided to take the matter in her hands and arrange for their rescue operation. Her husband was not a good swimmer.</p>\n<p>Thus, he could not participate in it.</p>\n<p>His wife took on a rubber boat and broke a window to get her hands on the toys. Soon, she emerged out with her rubber boat full of the action figures from Gundam (a Japanese military science fiction mixed media franchise). Her husband lent her a hand in getting his favorites out of the boat.</p>\n<p>A video capturing her heroic act surfaced on the Chinese micro-blogging website- Weibo. One can hear the husband saying, “I will never let you down in this life”. Not just that, another video showing the boat full of toys joined the narrative. It received more than 29000 likes and travelled around the world.</p>\n<p>As one takes a look at the figures and packages, one can see each of them costing around £20-£30 on Amazon.

Firstly, it was assigned the name, ‘Tempus of Morph’, moving forward to Lunar Larry and finally Buzz Lightyear. Not only this, one of the designs had LL belt buckle for Lunar Larry. It was only after the inclusion of Woody and Buzz in the movie theatres in 1995 that Pixar movies touched the hearts of millions all across the globe.</p>\n<p>Moving on, they became a part of the first fully computer-animated feature film.

The Colorado-based artist had used the spare time to make it noteworthy by making a vehement impression for the face masks. Since we’re in the moment where the need for face masks is at the pinnacle, everyone is so concerned about their façade as well. Stefanie’s mask would reveal the Marauder’s Map when you breathe out.</p>\n<p>She also has her online company CPEX (Colorado Pony Express, DYI). She is fond of making handmade plush toys and is currently selling all her homemade face masks. The reason for her flamboyant creation is to bring magic into the real world and also to bring a sense of creativity in others. Although the mask comes in the usual black color, you’d notice the change as soon as you put it on your mouth. Basically, it works by reacting to your breath, thereby slowly transforming into the image of Marauder&#8217;s Map, which reveals the arcane to get your way to Hogwarts.</p>\n<p>Talking about her artistry, Stefanie said: &#8220;I try to bring imagination to life in the creation of my products, ensuring that they are not one-dimensional items. I like to give the average person the ability to own items that are unique, and bring magic into the real world in hopes to further inspire others to create and be creative.&#8221; Also, several other considerations were taken into account before scaling this business.</p>\n<p>She took notes from the Centers for Disease Control as the use of face masks is now a necessity in a public place. The message on her website reads: &#8220;This face covering does not replace PPE such as N95 or surgical masks, this face-covering does not protect or mitigate diseases or viruses. Please follow CDC directives for best use. This face covering is best for hobbies, or cosplay.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, Stefanie comes up with a prototype for her creations before jumping into the production, which is why her TikTok video with a prototype of her masks showed up. She had made it for her fans to get an idea of how it would appear. However, she didn’t even know that she’d soon go viral. Though this nice creativity isn’t just an easy thing to obtain. Each mask requires several hours to create.</p>\n<p>Cutting fabric, treating the fabric, waiting for the fabric to set, and sewing a single mask together requires 17 hours in total, most of which is consumed by the waiting time for setting the fabric. So, she tries to manage it in an efficient way.

He added, “This is cyborg territory, and I intend to be a human guinea pig to see just how far we can turn science fiction into reality.” Sometimes the thought of losing his original voice would make him emotional and in need of empathy.</p>\n<p>MND came to him as a shock. He was living a normal day while he noticed that he wasn’t able to shake his foot. After going through various tests it was concluded that he was diagnosed with MND. His husband Francis was always there to support him and to listen to his robotic voice which was programmed to sing was a very sentimental jiffy for Francis and the entire family.</p>\n<p>Discovering about his partner&#8217;s disease was initially disturbing for Francis as he couldn’t see Peter’s body wither. While Francis was unsure about dealing with the shock, Peter looked at it optimistically. According to the medical predictions he had only two years to live and should have passed away last year.

Peter and Francis overcome every fear they face with a strong mindset towards situations. To live longer Peter is cooperating with artificial intelligence (AI) trailblazers and robotics enthusiasts.</p>\n<p>Together they had invented an AI structure that would enable him to utilize his eyes to direct an avatar that talks in his own voice. Using a catheter and colostomy bag and a tube he could now consume easily. He went through an operation to detach his esophagus and trachea, in which his original voice box was removed.</p>\n<p>He tweeted, “This is my last post as Peter 1.0. Tomorrow I trade my voice for potentially decades of life as we complete the final medical procedure for my transition to Full Cyborg, the month I was told statistically I would be dead. I’m not dying, I’m transforming. Oh, how I love science.”</p>\n<p>Peter took a lot of encouragement from Stephen Hawking whom he was fortunate enough to meet before his death. He expressed, “focus on what you can do, not on what you can’t because if you focus and get frustrated, and grieve too much – because that’s what it feels like, you’re grieving for all the life, all the things you could do – that is psychologically corrosive.”</p>\n<p>He wished to help the disabled ones for whom he has created the Scott-Morgan Foundation.

The article mentioned that the treat gets doubled when both, Satellites and Al algorithm program come together and produce the early warning for all those who were on the path of the storm that was, as previously mentioned, much powerful.

Now we have plenty of information or data that could update us about when? And where? Questions of the strike of the hurricanes. However, it is still a difficult part to guess the intensity of a hurricane, in which the latter is about to hit the land. As mentioned in the piece of article, by combining artificial intelligence and satellite data, the geniuses can easily save a lot more lives from being hit by the powerful storms.

The video came via Gizmodo.</p>\n<p>However, the video only witnessed a few seconds of the mighty fight in the front portion of the video. Nevertheless, those few seconds were enough to blow the minds of the audience. The flight took action as intended and Woodworth was definitely successful in his attempt. One could easily observe the aerial function of the pod working magnificently. Writing in the description of the video, Woodworth mentioned that this manufacture tested his endurance and vision at times in order to get all the gadgets to fit into one little shell.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1465\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1465\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1465\" src=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/New-Project-9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/New-Project-9.jpg 600w, https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/New-Project-9-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1465\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">YouTube</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As simple as it looked, the assembly of the gadget was not so easy. It gave the impression that Woodworth only needed to stick a drone onto a Hasbro toy, but the actual scenario was entirely different and difficult from this. Indeed, he had to develop a copy of the pod which was based on the new mission Fleet line; that was “out of polycarbonate; a transparent amorphous thermoplastic.” Highlighting the difficulties to make the pod, Woodworth in his video mentioned that the hardest part of all was to get the prop spacing to line up correctly. He included that there was &#8220;perhaps&#8221; a millimeter (.04 inches) of space between every one of the case&#8217;s four turning edges.</p>\n<p>The challenges were not over yet. Woodworth also had to manage space for a flight controller and a battery in the small area. But ultimately all the hard work paid off. The fruitful success of Woodworth’s creation was seen as a retail-ready prototype. According to Woodworth, even though it fitted the 6” Black Series Din Djarin, it was an inch wider and claimed that it was just a one-off. With his heart filled with joy, Woodworth mentioned that he made this toy just for fun. Also, it was in the memory of one of his favorite bits from the movie Star Wars.</p>\n<p>Hence indicating that all of us should probably wait until more Mandalorian build videos from Woodworth’s side came online.

But a ransom ware attack on the computer system of the hospital had jumbled the data. The computer system was made unserviceable. Due to the hack, the female patient could not be admitted to the hospital. The woman was then shifted to another hospital that was about 19 miles away. The long distance between the two hospitals disallowed the female patient from receiving revitalizing treatment that she badly required.</p>\n<p>As a result, the patient passed away in a hospital in Wuppertal. A negligent homicide case had been officially launched by the prosecutors in Cologne who claimed that the hackers can be blamed for the woman’s death. Detectives had collaborated with cyber-security experts to conclude that whether or not the hackers were responsible for the patient’s death. The former chief executive of the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, Ciaran Martin asserted that if the hackers were found to be accountable for the patient’s death then it would be the ‘first death directly caused by a cyber-attack’.</p>\n<p>Even the hospital would be interrogated. The president of Germany’s National Cyber- Security authority, Arne Schönbohm said that the officials had come on site to facilitate the hospital’s IT staff in order to rebuild the computer system. He even warned other organizations to protect their systems as hackers had misused a well-known vulnerability in a piece of Virtual Private Network software, developed by Citrix. He commented that they had warned of the vulnerability as early as January. He even said that he had pointed out the consequences of its exploitation.</p>\n<p>Arne further said that attackers can get into the internal network systems and paralyze those months later. He also added that the purpose of ransomware was to make money but unfortunately it ceases the system. Thus, if these attacks happen on a hospital’s computer system, such incidents were most likely to happen. He even affirmed that this shows the seriousness of authorities towards their system security.</p>\n<p>Martin said that it was not at all surprising that the origin of the issue was a ransomware attack by criminals rather than an attack by a nation state of terrorists. Some local reports suggested that the hackers did not intend to attack the hospital but were planning to attack a university. The hackers demanded payment from Heinrich Heine University, in a digital note that was sent during the attack. But it had cognate to a different location (hospital).</p>\n<p>As soon as the hackers realized their mistake, they gave the Düsseldorf University Hospital the decryption key without asking for the payment and then disappeared.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/severely-sick-patient-died-when-hackers-disrupted-hospital-computers/\">Severely Sick Patient Died When Hackers Disrupted Hospital Computers</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>The patient was in a critical situation and was headed towards Düsseldorf University Hospital for a revitalizing treatment on September 11.

This will help you to be different in the middle of a crowd wearing the same boring masks.</p>\n<p>The most beneficial part of the release of the mask is that it is promoting the wearing of the mask. A common citizen who is bored with a barrier around its face would be eager to wear a mask which is a little different in style. No matter the amount of profit the firm will make, their agenda of promoting the wearing of a mask is what that matters.</p>\n<p>In the situation we are living in, fighting COVID is the main aim.

How many times have we hoped for an encounter with our favorite character? Quite a lot!</p>\n<p>Seira Watanabe, 13, from Kansai, Japan has been an ardent fan of Godzilla. Her incredible collection of mini statues and figurines of the monster reflects her love for kaiju. This teenage girl even possesses the talent to imitate the famous roar of kaiju. Now, that’s a true fan.</p>\n<p>Watanabe decided to write to the producers of the television show Tantei Naito Sukūpu. The theme of the show revolves around a Detective Agency which takes requests from the viewers and then, these viewers may find themselves following the detectives on the mission.</p>\n<p>Since the TV show accepts various requests from their watchers, this girl submitted her request to go on a date with Godzilla. “My love is so great that I would like to marry Godzilla,” she mentioned in her letter.</p>\n<p>This TV show, Tantei Naito Sukūpu has been involved in numerous unusual challenges that have captivated their audience. They once took up the task of taming a &#8220;beast&#8221; in someone&#8217;s attic and turns out, the beast was a flying squirrel! Impressive, right? Here’s another one – they were challenged to bake the most gigantic loaf of bread. An intriguing challenge involved an egg and everyone putting in efforts to make it stand upright. Okay, these tasks spill enough about the show.</p>\n<p>If they could handle a huge bread dough and bake the biggest loaf, planning a date with Godzilla would be just a piece of cake for the producers and other staff of the show.</p>\n<p>They replied to Watanabe&#8217;s letter and finally, showed up at this girl’s house in Hyogo Prefecture. The hosts knocked on the door and an excited teenager revealed her love for kaiju by giving them a tour of her collection.</p>\n<p>The huge surprise waited right outside concealed with the window’s blinds. They were opened and kaiju stood there waiting for his biggest fan to run to him.</p>\n<p>Nothing could beat Watanabe’s reaction when she saw Godzilla standing there. She could stand or breathe for a moment as she tried to absorb the dreamy situation. She falls to the ground and gasps for air as she witnesses her love at an approachable distance from her.</p>\n<p>Watanabe’s grandfather chaperoned her on the date with kaiju. They went to the Godzilla Museum on Awaji Island, in Honshu Prefecture and strolled through the place holding hands.

This didn’t make them lose hope. The physicists at Princeton University in the US have used quantum mechanics to search for a mathematical escape clause. According to them, this would help them to create a wormhole sufficiently large for humans and their spacecraft.</p>\n<p>The scientists applied math to speculate conditions that could make a wormhole achievable and even visualized what one would look like. The wormhole was described by them in detail. From the outside, it bears a resemblance to intermediate-mass charged black holes. The reason for their big size is so that a human traveler can get through the tidal forces.</p>\n<p>It takes a very short proper time to travel through, but a long time as seen from the outside. The traveler obtains a very large uplifted factor when they go past the center of the wormhole. They also told that they have concluded that the wormhole exists in a cold and flat ambient space. They are yet to give any plausible mechanism for their formation. They only knew that they are configurations allowed by the equations.</p>\n<p>In an ideal world, wormholes could act as a magical doorway which can let people access another time or galaxy. It is a bit perplexing theory but a wormhole is basically a theoretical method of folding space and time so two places in space can be connected together.</p>\n<p>The admirers of the movie interstellar would be better known to this concept. The movie shows how astronauts on a spacecraft managed to travel through a wormhole in a short span of time they had, but for people living on earth, hundreds or even thousands of years could have passed. It is like joining two dots on paper so that it forms a line, folding the paper over to overlap the dots and then forcing your pen through the page. The hole generated represents the wormhole.</p>\n<p>Einstein conjectured that space-time can be tangled up so tightly that two points can share the same physical location. Then all you need is a short wormhole between the two for instantaneous travel. Wormholes could be hypothetically possible to invent but would continue to be unworkable unless more advanced technology is developed.</p>\n<p>This is what Physics experts Juan Maldacena and Alexey Milekhin have been trying to prove. They depended on something called the 5-dimensional warped geometry theory, which suggests that the Universe is in five dimensions. A five-dimensional universe would permit something called negative energy to exist and it’s this that the scientists think could make a wormhole stable and large. Then they would just need the right tools to operate the negative energy.</p>\n<p>Some astronomers think we should look for natural wormholes in space by observing how gravity is distorting light behind stars.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wormholes-for-humans-to-travel-through-time-and-space-may-be-possible/\">Wormholes For Humans To Travel Through Time And Space May Be Possible</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Although physics endorse the idea of wormholes, there are many scientists who have agreed that they would be undersized and unreliable for a person to travel.

I attended a toy convention with a friend back in December 2019 and saw a guy selling dioramas. I was about to buy one when I thought maybe I should try making it myself for half the price.

The study reveals that video games can help a person improve their reading skills and creative writing skills. Along with this it also improves literacy skills and a person’s emotional wellbeing. The study surveyed 4,626 young people aged 6 to 11 in the United Kingdom. Almost three fourth (75%) of these kids thought that they were a part of the story which leads to their creativity and literacy skills. 65% of these kids could imagine being someone else due to the video games. This led to developing empathy.</p>\n<p>Most of the parents also accepted that gaming helped their kids socialize and keep in touch with their friends and family during the lockdown.

It’s exciting to uncover the opportunities that video games playing can provide for young people to engage in reading, stimulate creativity through writing, enhance communication with friends and family, and support empathy and wellbeing.

After all it is Wolverine contrary to Ghost Rider and it cannot be more 90s than this!</p>\n<p>The next character vivified was Todd McFarlane’s cover to Spawn #300. Though the cover is not from the 90s but McFarlane acclaimed another cover. He adulates a former Spider-man cover from that epoch.

This vehicle was called the “U-shift”. It was distinctive-looking and has been defined as a sample vehicle with several operations, including cargo and human transport. Its application is well-fitted onto the main body of the automobile just like one large game of Tetris.</p>\n<p>It was named U-shift because of the U-shape drive board it accommodated. The Drive board is the section of the vehicle that the wheels are on and other applications are attached to it. One can assume it as a new-age advanced looking cab without the cargo bed at the back. This proposition acquired just over $14 million from the Baden-Wurttemberg Ministry for Economic Affairs, Labour and Housing. It was also awarded at the Interim Conference of the Strategic Dialogue for the Automotive Sector in Germany.</p>\n<p>If you’re questioning how someone would sit in the drive board itself, it has been found out that no one needs to be driving it as the U-shift’s current prototype can be controlled by a remote. There were many questions which were raised on this concept. One of which was regarding the seating of the people. In the whatever capsule is attached to the drive board, such as its fancy looking bus capsule. The passenger capsule supposedly has eight seats in addition to a folding one. It also has a ramp for increased accessibility.</p>\n<p>Telling about the new vehicle, DLR Executive Board Member for Energy and Transport Professor Karsten Lemmer said that with the adaptable idea of U-Shift, they were making an important contribution to the alteration of mobility. Creating a model illustrating the typical qualities was quite necessary, especially for the adoption of innovative concepts by the automotive industry or logistics and mobility service providers. In this way, researchers and future users could experience and improve the mobile world of tomorrow in real life.</p>\n<p>DLR’s Minister of Economic Affairs, Dr. Nicole Hoffmeister-Kraut further added that the main motive behind all this was to build future mobility which was capable of being continued at a certain level and was more effective and comfortable.</p>\n<p>A second, fully automated version of the U-Shift is apparently in the process with the aim of it being ready for 2024. According to its website, it would be able to travel at 60 kilometers per hour (around 37 mph).</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/engineers-develop-vehicle-that-can-change-from-a-bus-to-a-cargo-van/\">Engineers Develop Vehicle That Can Change From A Bus To A Cargo Van</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>The invention was not literally for a movie but was created by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) so that it could be employed for different purposes and industrial uses.

Since its inception in Japan in 1994, Sony’s PlayStations have always been a dream for gamers across the world. The previous version, Ps4, made history by being the fastest-selling console in the world, selling over a million units in a day. And now its latest console has just launched in the market and its specifications are awe-striking. The new PlayStation is offering amazing graphics and ray tracing along with a custom-made AMD RDNA 2 graphics unit and allows variable frequency. It’s a strong competition to Xbox series X and series 5. It is no doubt that PS5 offers a captivating user experience.</p>\n<p>Naturally, gamers across the world had their hands on it, with many people pre-ordering it as fast as they can, since the pre-order window was open for a short period. Needless to say, it sold out in an instant. Since then, the new stock hardly comes in the market and just as fast sells out.</p>\n<p>Apart from its popularity, there is the question of price as well. It’s not exactly affordable with the cheapest variant being priced at $399. However, this player had found a temporary solution to his dilemma.</p>\n<p>He became a little crafty and made the PS5 replica with cardboard and some printouts. For the controller, he cut out the shape of it from cardboard and glued the DualSense Pad printout plainly over the shape. As for the console, he materialized by painting a rectangular box black and sticking 2 white cardboard sheets on either side of the box. To top it off, they even added two slots for the USB portal to complete the look.</p>\n<p>An eBay user named mckanmillio listed it for sale on the shopping platform for $399, the same price for the actual PS5. Along with it, they wrote a sweet note saying, “Took around three hours to make. Retail price. Probably won’t be able to afford a real one ;(. But if someone actually considers buying this I would be beyond thankful.” Pretty wholesome, right?</p>\n<p>Since then, the listing has been removed. No one is sure if the user closed the listing or someone really bought it.

No doubt, the person thought that people should enjoy themselves in a disciplined manner. However, parents must take in charge of monitoring and regulating the time spent by their kids in the digital or virtual world.</p>\n<p>However, in hindsight, severe time limits like half an hour on week nights and an hour or two at weekends can be little grinding. Well, Ewan ensured that the readers don’t have to be the victim of the same destiny that he did when he was young. It turned out that playing video games for at least a few hours a week for a kid within 14 years of age had shown quantifiable and verifiable progress on the brain functions that lasted until adulthood.</p>\n<p>The person urged its readers to hurry up and inform this to their primary care provider as soon as possible. This valuable and cheerful news came through a study conducted by the Universität Oberta de Catalunya. Although, the study’s main aim was to find whether or not transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with gaming would impact brain functions. In addition to this, the researchers found that the act of gaming alone provided a level-up to memory, spatial understanding, and response times.</p>\n<p>Gradually, this led to the conclusion that those people who had played video games in their childhood were able to carry forward those benefits in their adulthood. A study was conducted where two groups were compared, the first group was of adults who had never played games as kids and the other group consisted of the adults who had played video games in their childhood. The study recorded a baseline of the participant&#8217;s cognitive skills where the first group lagged behind the other.</p>\n<p>Following this, both groups were given the fun filled activity of playing Super Mario 64 for 1.5 hours a day, every day for ten days. Cognitive skills were then measured again following the period, and then another 15 days later with no more access to video games in the meantime. As predicted, the results showed that those who had not gamed as kids scored lower on the first cognitive tests.</p>\n<p>Following the period of playing Super Mario 64, however, the other group soon caught up and had similar scores to the group who played video games when they were kids. Some questions were still brimming and there was data that had to be assessed as this was not the aim of the study.

Matthew mentioned that earlier their videos got around five million views. But as the pandemic situation started, their views averaged 10 million! They have also seen engagement rise by about 30-40%. They have now aimed to move to the US and start their own company.</p>\n<p>As the brothers turned 20 years old, they individually earned at least $1,00,000 per year. When compared with the average UK salary, what they earn is more than thrice the average. Isn’t that amazing? The brothers invested their funding in a right direction.

This is almost half of the population playing games in the entire world. This list is seconded by Europe with 668 million people paying for games.

Many even found it strange. People went on commenting about how similar the two gamers looked while they wore their jumpers. There was a sarcastic comment saying that it looked so satisfying to see them pose with something that they disliked.</p>\n<p>The incident evidently concludes that the two gamers / co-workers / friends had an applaudable sense of humor and exactly similar style.

The stock had previously seen a jump of over 1,625%. Investment brokers and partnerships predicted that the share price of GameStop would fall in future.

So children and teenagers being the hardcore fans began demanding. The prequels were almost ten years away, but Lucasfilm presented new stories in the form of novels, comics and video games. This lot was eventually known as the &#8220;Expanded Universe&#8221;. The first to come up was the novel “Heir to the Empire” by Timothy Zahn. It was with the original trio Luke, Leia and Han. Here is where the Great Admiral Thrawn emerged from the depths of the galaxy.</p>\n<p>Being a military genius, he turned the rest of the Imperial Fleet into a real threat to the New Republic. This blue, red-eyed alien on the book cover was quite fascinating! Thrawn was described as a member of Chiss species by the trilogy of Zahn that continued in Dark Force rise and Last Command. Due to his brilliant and tactical mind, he became one of the only non-human characters serving in the Imperial Navy. He appreciated his officers and inspired fidelity. Unlike previous Imperials, he was seen interested in art and culture.</p>\n<p>At the end of this famous trilogy, Thrawn died. But that wasn’t the end of his legacy. Disney&#8217;s purchase of Lucasfilm in 2012 completely turned the tables. Expanded Universe became non-canonical and was re-branded as &#8220;Legends.&#8221; The first was Thrawn&#8217;s introduction into animated Star Wars: Rebels in 2016, as the first antagonist in his series. Thrawn not only came to life in animated form at last, but during this time Zahn also returned to creation. He wrote a new trilogy of In-Canon novels: Star Wars: Thrawn, Thrawn: Alliances and Thrawn: Treason.</p>\n<p>Many cool characters never made a transition and so were introduced as new characters altogether. Thrawn was the only one who survived virtually. Maybe this is because of his symbolic Star Wars&#8217; long history. He has a special place in his Fans&#8217; hearts. Thrawn didn’t have any connection to any of the original characters of a film. So without any big change in his character, it was easy to lift him into his new canon. Thrawn was finished in continuity with the series finale of Rebelles.</p>\n<p>The unknown regions of the galaxy weren’t mapped, so they were very difficult to navigate. But he survived the events of the Rebels Finale! Thanks to the name of Ahsoka, Thrawn, in episode 13 of the Mandalorian. In the old canon of the legends, the regeneration of Thrawn following the Emperor&#8217;s death was a kind of warm-up for the eventual return of Palpatine to Dark Horse&#8217;s Dark Empire saga.</p>\n<p>The stories occurred about a year after the Zahn trilogy, and Palpatine re-emerged in a new clone to once again take over his Empire. He also wanted the unborn child of Leia and Han for its Dark Side energy as a new host. To conclude, it would be great if Thrawn&#8217;s introduction to live acts on the printed page, almost 30 years ago, reflected his original conception.</p>\n<p>Thrawn&#8217;s going to come, people.

So, he opted for Tiberius as his middle name and Jacob as his official first name.</p>\n<p>He revealed that he first met his wife sci-fi convention and so, including a Star Trek character in his moniker made sense. Apparently, he had utterly disappointed someone after making this decision.</p>\n<p>“The only one who isn&#8217;t completely in awe of my incredible new name is (understandably) my mom. She wanted me to just swap the names (Jacob Donald Lastname) so I still have my grandpa&#8217;s name somewhere in there,” he explained in the Reddit post.</p>\n<p>“She’s annoyed I&#8217;m putting a joke name over a sentimental one and she&#8217;s very vocal about hating Tiberius and thinking it&#8217;s stupid and embarrassing.”</p>\n<p>He wanted to know if he had jumped in haste on the wrong path. Many Reddit users commented and justified his action with their opinions. One wrote, “It is not a joke name. It is a lifestyle name and it is yours. None of anyone’s business, including the one who named you.”</p>\n<p>“While your mom may be upset, it is not her who has to live with the name. If she wants the name around she should change her name,” another blurted out.</p>\n<p>Other people didn’t want to be a part of this battle and considered both the teams to be right at their end.</p>\n<p>One user expressed, “Names are the first gift you give your child. And your name was to honor your grandfather. That you would pick a joke name is kind of disrespectful. But&#8230; while it&#8217;s a little disrespectful, I think your mom&#8217;s reaction is out line as well.”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/man-changes-his-name-in-honor-of-his-favorite-tv-character-but-mom-disapproves/\">Man Changes His Name In Honor Of His Favorite TV Character But Mom Disapproves</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>When the big choice is made between giving you a name that’s rare only for a few days and the one that would sound like an ancient anecdote after a while, you are not involved.

It combines the look of the iconic PlayStation 2 with the next-gen console, and the marriage between the two is quite stunning. This design&#8217;s inspiration is taken by the special edition PlayStation 4, which was launched in 2014.

The smooth shades and muted grey filled the console with plenty of texture. It even comes with the throwback colored PlayStation logo emblazoned on the bottom portion of the faceplate, adding a contrast to the dark colors. The DualSense controller resembles the DualShock controllers with its all-black scheme and colored buttons. There is also a stamp that numbers the limited console, just like the previous homage to the PS1 had.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth stressing that this design is not real whatsoever and is just a concept design for the foreseeable future. It is based around the 30th anniversary of PlayStation, which is still four years far. Also, it is unclear how PlayStation will explore customization and alternative editions of the PS5. Fans will be expecting special editions of PS5 in the coming years to coincide with the release of flagship games.</p>\n<p>Still, suppose Sony is already putting together ideas to celebrate such an occasion. In that case, they should definitely pull inspiration from this one because it looks spectacular. One thing to note is that if Sony releases a special edition of PS5, it would be quite limited, seeing that Sony only created 12,300 versions of the PS4 special edition console worldwide.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/guy-created-a-ps2-themed-ps5/\">Guy Created A PS2 Themed PS5</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>But some consumers are not a massive fan of its large, all-white design.

Elements that exhibit similar properties are arranged in the same row &amp; columns.</p>\n<p>A periodic table assists us to understand chemistry in a better way and it also amplifies our knowledge of science too. We should have been taught this way before but it’s better late than never. This new version of the periodic table would enable us to be versed with all those things that we have missed out on while we were learning it, for instance, it would tell us that Boron is used in making sports equipment and Sulphur is found in eggs. Poison has arsenic in it and our toothpaste has got Fluorine in them.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1590\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1590\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1590\" src=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/New-Project-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"280\" srcset=\"https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/New-Project-1-1.jpg 600w, https://thenerdseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/New-Project-1-1-300x140.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1590\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Imgur</figcaption></figure>\n<p>We cannot deny that science is all around us, though we could choose to stay oblivious towards it or we could accept and try to be more aware of it.

So, this new way of learning would redeem children from the onus of so-called ‘knowledge’, they would get to read and know more about elements in a super easy and intriguing way.</p>\n<p>It is not only beneficial for children but adults as well, as periodic table is considered to be one of the most useful scientific tools. Adults could enhance their knowledge and they can help their kids too, because learn and emulate their parents only. It is totally acceptable if people don’t hold any information about the periodic table, chemistry and science for that matter.

The flat Earth theory states that the earth is rather flat or disk-like and not round. While there are many who do not believe that, there are many other who believe the theory of flat-earth.</p>\n<p>The statements by Marc might come off as a joke to many, but Marc remains serious over his plans.

For most of the masses, the origin of this frequently trusted fallacy that action games lead to the development of violent behavior is the calamitous 1999 Columbine High School massacre. This school shooting left the world aghast and led so many people to think that media was the reason behind the actions of the two students.</p>\n<p>On the contrary, a recent study has found that the interrelation between video game carnage and actual life actions is pragmatically unreal. Issued in the journal Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, the study about the non-existent relationship between the two is named ‘Growing Up with Grand Theft Auto: A 10-Year Study of Longitudinal Growth of Violent Video Game Play in Adolescents.’ In the conduction of this study, young gamers were followed for 10 years to see if the game influenced them.</p>\n<p>The study adopted an individual-centric approach that examined participants by employing algorithms over variables like gender, socioeconomic status and other factors. This denoted that variables that occur to a person are gauged. The subject group comprised of 65% Caucasian, 12% Black, 19% multi-ethnic and 4% other ethnic group individuals. All of these people were from a ‘large north-western city’. The study established that boys are likely to play bloody video games more than girls and it recognized three subsets of behavior too.</p>\n<p>There were ‘high-initial violence players’ in the study that constituted 4% of the examination and were tagged so because they played many violent games from an early age. Contrariwise, there also were categorizations like ‘moderate initial violence’ which constituted 23% of the study and ‘low initial violence’ which accounted for 73% of the study. It was found that ‘high initial violence player’ moderately played less violent games over the timespan of 10 years. In addition to this, it was also observed that these players tended to get depressed when they decided to play bloody games.</p>\n<p>In spite of this, it was found in the study that there is no distinction between philanthropic behavior at the concluding time point across all the three groups. It therefore appears that violent action games do not have enduring effects on the players. However, those who are little may be more fascinated by the action-based titles.

There were some existing differences between the couple regarding the name of the baby.</p>\n<p>The boyfriend wanted to name the baby after a fictional character of Twilight, a book written by Stephenie Meyer. He liked the name “Renesmee” and was stressing out on the name. On the other hand, the mother was not a fan of naming the baby on some fictional character.</p>\n<p>There was friction going on between the couple when the boyfriend crossed the limit. The boyfriend was struck by the name he chose and was not ready to compromise. The to-be mum hated the idea as she was not a fan of Twilight. Neither of them was ready to compromise and they refused to conclude.</p>\n<p>When the boyfriend posted the name on Instagram, things got escalated. The post made the to-be mum furious. Nonetheless, she demanded her boyfriend to take down his post and discuss the matter further. However, he refused to do so and closed all the possible options from his side to change the name.</p>\n<p>Furious girlfriend kicked her boyfriend out of the house and he had to spend the night at his friend’s. Even her parents supported the boyfriend and insisted on her in making compromises. They asked her to stop being unreasonable and start being a little considerate. They even insisted on the point that the name might mean a lot to the boyfriend and she should just “let it go”.</p>\n<p>Therefore, she reached out to the internet to know whether her reaction was unreasonable? She even admitted to the fact that she has a stuttering problem and she couldn’t pronounce the name “Renesmee” properly. The reactions of the commenters were enough to let the to-be mum know that she was right on her point.</p>\n<p>One of the commenters was of the view that naming a child is a two people thing. Using social media tactics to manipulate the name in his favor was indeed a selfish act. Thus, the girl’s reaction was valid. The commenter even warned everyone to be aware of this kind of people.</p>\n<p>The parents were criticized as well for not standing up to their daughter. They were wrong to support the guy who didn’t respect their daughter and went out of the way in deciding names.</p>\n<p>Some even suggested that if the guy decided the name alone, then she should just sign the birth certificate without him. This would make him realize that giving birth and taking the child’s decision is a two-person thing. A kid has to live their life with the name throughout the school. Deciding the name should be the decision of both of the parents.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/mom-to-be-angry-at-boyfriend-for-announcing-baby-name-based-on-twilight/\">Mom-To-Be Angry At Boyfriend For Announcing Baby Name Based On ‘Twilight’</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Deciding a name for the baby is one of the most important decisions parents make.

Before they were tested on these indicators, each player was asked various questions to know their gaming habits. After which, each player’s IQ level was established.

Whereas, players who chose Among Us had a score of 118.9. Minecraft players achieved a score of 116.3 which was considered respectable. Then came the gamers who played Call Of Duty.

Furthering down the level, candy crush saga players got a score of 96.4 and those of angry birds were at 95.8.</p>\n<p>The results were quite shocking. The whole set of statistics was published publicly for one to infer. However, a sample size of 1,001 people was considered too small to rely on the conclusions blindly.

The toy went completely out of sight after attending such a tiring and stressful flight, following COVID-19 norms side by side along with attending to her child.</p>\n<p>So, in comparison to all this, taking care of a small toy seemed pretty trivial. While they were traveling, Hagen realized that Buzz was not with him and got so devastated about not being able to find him. He had a bedroom full of action figures, Buzz and Woody pajamas, and watches all four movies multiple times each week so not being able to find his only favorite toy was a huge disappointment for him. The only option the parents were left with was to reclaim the toy through the official process but unfortunately, the process cost them more than the price of the toy itself.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the family returned to their home in Elk Grove, Sacramento. Around a week later they received an email from Jason which mentioned that he had found Hagen’s toy so he wanted the details of their residence. The delivery was received so quickly owing to the fact that Texas was in the midst of a huge freeze. The kid was so overwhelmed and excited when he received the much-awaited parcel.

Coming back to the PS5, the use of it would not be different than the other PS5s and would work the same way they do.</p>\n<p>In addition to the PS5, he also made a rather large controller to go along with it. Of course, because playing with this large of a PS5 a regular sized controller would be rather irrational. The video titled, “I Spent 100 Hours Customizing The World’s Largest PS5 ($70000).” What to note is that, he not spent this much of a money, but also spent 100 hours to complete this project. In the video, it was featuring a competition between ZHC and his friends. The competition was that, both of them would paint either side of the PS5.</p>\n<p>The competition had a task to do for the one who would lose as well. If ZHC would lose, he would have to give one PS5 each to his team members and the remaining to a charity. Additionally, he would give away the large PS5 to a random stranger. ZHC did win the game, but still gave away 100 ‘regular sized’ PS5 to his subscribers. He gives away many things to his subscribers, many which are customized. He has also previously surprised some other youtubers with some customized gifts.</p>\n<p>This time, ZHC’s giveaway would actually help anyone who would want one a lot. Some might say that this would be one’s best chance to get one because of the shortage and trouble people are facing to get one. So many people want the PS5, it has actually become a shortage for Sony production. It may not be as major as some other shortages the world is facing, but it still is a shortage.

The hydraulic struts not only help to keep the kart at a certain level but also moves as a reaction to the driver’s cart.</p>\n<p>Although David has been accustomed to the process of making simulators, as he owns a company that makes high-end simulators. The system of the simulator is based on Mario Kart: Home Circuit game which was released in 2019. Players often use physical carts, that make their living room or other real-world spaces into Mario Kart courses, all of this becomes possible with the help of augmented reality. Drivers or Players customarily get a driver&#8217;s view because there are cameras that are attached to the cars. Also, players are required to steer through the physical gates that are placed on the floor in order to complete the race.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned instructions are to be kept in mind while using a normal simulator, the simulator that David’s company developed works in a different manner when compared to a normal one. In a normal simulator, the players control their carts using a Nintendo switch. David has created the simulator in such a manner that it even has even got a wheel underneath the seat that has the power to spin the contraption. Accelerometers have been attached to the cart and it fires data to the PC that has been apparently fixed to the simulator. In an interview, he said that the simulator developed by him would surely be successful in rendering players with the ultimate Mario Kart experience.</p>\n<p>He further said that gaming is something that transports people somewhere else, it makes them believe that they are doing something that they couldn’t have done otherwise. And he tries to make that experience even better and more realistic. David has certainly been successful in developing an amazing yet intriguing simulator, and it is certainly making people’s experiences better.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/dad-develops-an-amazing-mario-kart-simulator-for-nintendo-fan-son/\">Dad Develops An Amazing Mario Kart Simulator For Nintendo Fan Son</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>David Wiernicki, who is settled in New York, brilliantly used his technological knowledge and mind to create the simulator for his 12-year-old son Draco.

Contemporarily in 2009, Dr. David Clarke, of Sheffield Hallam University was working with the MoD and rediscovered these drawings.</p>\n<p>Dr. Clarke used these drawings in documentation of a book called, “UFO Drawings From The National Archives.” Teacher named Mrs. Hindmarsh was responsible for handing over these drawings by students who spotted something mysterious in a field 200 yards away at Broad Haven in West Wales all these years back. Clarke said, He opened the file and saw various kinds of crayon drawings and wondered if they were credible. He felt that, if the teacher felt it was serious enough to be mentioned then it might as well hold some accuracy to it.<br />\nS<br />\nInterestingly, The sci-fi movie Extra-Terrestrial was released 5 years later. Dr. Clarke continues to explain how the cop, who received the report first hand, sent the report to air traffic control in Manchester to see if there was any spotting. The documented report of this case was forwarded to MoD, UFO dept. ahead, who thoroughly investigated the drawings. Everyone was amazed.

In a gap of three years, the researchers and scientist checked with the kids who were then 14 years old and asked them questions about depressive symptoms, such as low mood, poor concentration and loss of pleasure. The results were astounding as scientists found out that the boys who had played video games maximum time had exhibited a 24 per cent reduction in depressive symptoms (after three years) than the boys who played the video games only once a month.</p>\n<p>Adding to this, this phenomenon was seen only in boys with low levels of physical activity and not in girls. The study&#8217;s lead author, PhD student Aaron Kandola from UCL Psychiatry told that screen and digital devices allowed kids to throw themselves into an extensive range of activities. He further added that guidelines, rules and recommendations about screen time should be based on a deep insight on how they influence people’s mental health and whether that influence is positive or negative.</p>\n<p>The researchers were not sure whether playing video games could improve mental health but it seemed that it was not harmful and didn’t have a negative impact. Of course, the pandemic had proven that social media platform like video games had been an indispensable part for youngsters. He enlightened on the fact that people need to reduce how much time children, and adults, spend sitting down, for their physical and mental health, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that screen use was detrimental and malign.</p>\n<p>In another study, scientist found out that girls who spent more time using social media were more likely to develop depressive symptoms. 11-year-old girls who used social media were prone to report depressive symptoms 13 times more than the girls who used their social media less than once a month. Senior author Dr Mats Hallgren, of the Karolinska Institute, added that the understanding of screen time and mental health is a bit complex because their relationship is quite complicated. Researchers and scientists still need to dive deep into their research for a clear and better understanding.</p>\n<p>He further added that any initiatives to reduce young people&#8217;s screen time should be targeted and nuanced. Their research hunted for the possible upside of screen time. However, he pointed that people still need to persuade and motivate young people to be physically active and to cut off the extended periods of sitting with light physical activity.

Call it ‘out of spite’ or anything, but Youtuber Bob Wulff came up with an interesting concept to watch Tenet on something unusual.</p>\n<p>Popularly known as Wulff Den, the YouTuber wondered if he could watch the movie on the smallest screen possible and GameBoy Advance was the only option. Although Nolan had already said that the conglomeration of both the sound as well as image in the movie is worth watching on the big screen, the pandemic was a big occlusion to his expectations. This was one of the reasons why Wulff tried to find an alternative. A movie would never be someone’s priority during such an unprecedented crisis.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, several memes related to Nolan’s suggestion of watching the movie in theatres were being shared on social media, the global pandemic was a huge concern for most of us. Wulff needed five cartridges because the maximum time for any video to be played on a GameBoy Advance is not more than 30 minutes. Moreover, he also created his own labels for all the cartridges. He admits that it might be one of the worst ways to watch Tenet but it still counts as a possible way to make it viewable in the first place.</p>\n<p>And if you too are wondering how he did it, he has explained all the steps for people like him. Also, Nolan himself isn’t much concerned about how people are going to watch his movies. It’s totally their preference and he had clearly said it when he was asked the same during Dunkirk’s release. He elucidated that these films are mainly released on the bigger screens and the overall experience definitely drops down depending on the size of the screen. The cinematic experience and how you assimilate the story would be quite different when you’re watching something on an iPad.</p>\n<p>So, it turns out that he never warned anyone of watching shows outside theatres, and apparently, he might not have expected to run it on something like GameBoys. And for people like Wulff who have put such comparisons aside, Tenet running on a smaller screen still does the work.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/youtuber-converted-nolans-tenet-onto-gameboy-advance/\">YouTuber Converted Nolan’s Tenet Onto GameBoy Advance</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Nolan’s movie may come once in a while, but the ones that do are mind-boggling and sometimes bamboozling as well.

Apparently, the mother wanted to name her son after her favorite film character, which was later opposed by her soon-to-be father just after when they got aware of the fact that they were going to raise a little baby boy. Initially, the pair had no idea about what they were going to name their child. Later, when the big news was shared among their family members, all of them started to come up with their own suggestions.</p>\n<p>But as the mother already had thought of a name, the couple didn’t really pay much heed to other’s ideas. And once the discussion was done again, she disclosed the name to her husband claiming she wanted to name their child ‘Frodo’. While at the same time, her husband was taken aback by not being aware of the fact that she had already made her mind without having mutual consent. On knowing the name, he was antagonistic and refused his agreement for the name. Since she was very much adamant about her decision, even she refused the same.</p>\n<p>The guy was called ‘dictator’ after he refused the name. The name ’Frodo’ came from a movie character whom she admired the most. She went on explaining how she loved the name for it being so cool and different and she had it in mind ever since. Yet again, her husband rejected the idea. She strongly felt that the movie was a popular one and so was the name. And probably that was also the reason the guy didn’t want to go ahead with that name.</p>\n<p>He wanted to give his son his own identity and not attached to the character she was talking about. Following this, things started to get more intense between the two. According to him, their son was much more than a random film character and that decision should be taken with a lot more sincerity and both of them needed to have a mutual say and not just the mother. Irrespective of all the things being said, she was still unswerving. Neither of the two was ready to settle down so eventually, their stubbornness led to a major argument.</p>\n<p>After hearing about it, his wife’s sister insisted that a mother had 80% right to make decisions for her baby and he should stop stressing her out during her pregnancy as it could have deleterious effects on the baby. Feeling helpless, the guy posted his experience on social media to know about people’s perspectives on his decision. And fortunately, most of them supported his decision because in the end they are a couple and they should handle it like a couple only!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com/dad-refuses-to-name-son-after-wifes-favorite-film-character/\">Dad Refuses To Name Son After Wife’s Favorite Film Character</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenerdseries.com\">The Nerd Series</a>.</p>\n","description":"<p>Well, a couple did go through a similar situation.

Meanwhile thanking his fans, Stephen mentioned the unbelievable win that he surprisingly never waited for to happen even though being second on the list, preceding Ray. He was still a bit hesitant about his position of being constant or not as he himself knew that he always focused on completing games rather than winning points so losing his newly achieved position could be an easy slip.</p>\n<p>However, he could never deny the fact that reaching that level was definitely a big milestone for him that he had now successfully passed. People were also intrigued about the certainty that those two had some sort of agreement between themselves for Stephen to remain #2 but the misinterpretation was cleared soon by Stephen himself regarding no such agreement.

Surprised by his decision, Kimberly shared a picture online to spread the word. The family tried their level best to procure funds.</p>\n<p>Kimberly started a “Go Fund Me” initiative online. She created a page on a social networking website wherein people could donate money for their cause. Their goal was to receive $800.

They were moved by the love between Bryson and Bruce. Bryson was overwhelmed by the response. He was happy to see that his dog will be alright soon. He appreciated all the love people poured in!</p>\n<p>Within a week’s treatment Bruce was reunited with his family. Although there were many vaccine appointments lined up for Bruce, but he started doing great after a week. Bryson was the happiest but the story didn’t end here!
